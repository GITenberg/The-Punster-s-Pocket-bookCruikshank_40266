<p>I may with great propriety contend, that under
such merry designation, I am addressing a very
large portion of the British public. If, beneath
your patronage, this little work should prove as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
successful as the flattering anticipations of some
friendly adepts in the art of punning have induced
me to expect, it is my intention to collect and
publish, annually, all the choicest <i>Morceaux</i> and
Vagaries relating to punning that can be obtained
from the wits and witty works of our own times:
for which purpose I solicit communications of <i>original</i>
Puns and Epigrams, directed to my Publishers.
In arranging the present work, I have
endeavoured to bring together all that was important
to a proper understanding of the Merry
Art; to which are annexed examples by the most
celebrated Punsters of their day; many of which
now, for the first time, appear in print. Illustrated
by fourteen original and appropriate designs,
from that mirth-inspiring graphic humourist,
Robert Cruikshank.</p>

<p>For mine own whims, scattered here and there
through the work, they will, I have no doubt, be
easily discovered, by their very humble pretensions
to any right of admission into the phalanx of great
names in whose company they are now associated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
But, Wits and Critics, as ye are powerful, be merciful;
and remember, that taste and industry for
such a task are the great requisites of a compiler,
and that it is not essentially necessary for a <i>good</i>
collector to be a <i>great</i> artist.</p>

<p>The Genius of Ancient Britain is represented by a Druidical
head encircled by a wreath of oak; the face is partly
hidden behind the blazonry of modern achievement. The
head, supported by the Roman eagle and the Saxon horse,
is inclosed in the involutions of the scroll which proceeds
from it, and which next embraces the devouring eagle of
Scandinavia, and the warlike lion of Normandy. Following
these are emblems of the contests of the houses of York and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Lancaster, surrounded by the rival roses. The Scriptures
opened are appropriate to the Tudor family; and their national
emblem, the thistle, is considered most emblematical
of the Stuart race. A lion, with the cap of liberty, denotes
the benefits England has derived from their successors, the
Prince of Orange; and the unicorn chained to the scroll is
indicative of Hanover attached to the sovereignty of Great
Britain. The imperial crown of Charlemagne, which surmounts
Brunswick, is nearly obscured and lost behind the
crown and sceptre of a British sovereign, George the Fourth,</p>

<p>It will doubtless be the opinion of many a reader
that a Prefatory Essay on such a subject as <i>Punning</i>
can possess little of interest, and nothing of novelty.
I would, however, request any one entertaining
this idea to suspend his judgment till he has given
the matter ampler consideration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>In addressing these preliminary remarks to punsters
in general, I think I have taken effectual means
to render them of universal interest. When a certain
author, who had dedicated one of his volumes
"<i>to those who think</i>," was charged with want of
judgment in catering for such a limited number of
individuals, he justified his discernment by observing,
that, however little numerous the body of <i>thinking
people</i> might be, every reader would at least rank
himself in that class. Our question can stand on
much broader ground; for we assert, without fear
of contradiction, that of the many judicious persons
who, without doubt, will peruse and patronise these
pages, not one will be found who is not only, <i>se judice</i>,
a punster, but who has not, probably "many
a time and oft," exhibited among his boon companions
whatever portion of talent he may possess
in that line of wit. It has been asked by a well-known
writer, "Did any man of liberal education
ever go through his teens without perpetrating the
crime of making verses?" I am contented to wave
the narrow distinction, by which uneducated persons
would be excepted, and, with respect to the
nobler and far more generally diffused art of punning,
would inquire, Does any one, whatever be his
rank or attainments, reach his twentieth year, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>out
(we will not speak so inaccurately as to say,
<i>perpetrating the crime</i>, but) contributing one or
more puns to the common stock? Certainly not.
What the ancients rather hyperbolically asserted
of writing (for the many, who were uninstructed in
the mechanical part of that art, could not by possibility
have exercised it), <i>Scribimus indocti doctique</i>,
is literally true as applied to punning: lettered and
unlettered, all alike pun away. From the humble
son of Crispin, who, having nothing but one of his
sutorial weapons at hand wherewith to despatch his
<i>cotelette de b&#339;uf</i>, remarked that <i>his all was at stake</i>,
to the gifted Sheridan, who discovered that Doctors'
Commons was the greatest thoroughfare in
England, in virtue of the old adage, "where there
is a <small>WILL</small> there is a <small>WAY</small>," each man sports his
<i>calembourg</i>.</p>

<p>Still, as it frequently happens that what is most
generally practised, is far from being best understood,
so is it with punning. It has been too much
the case to treat it with levity and inconsiderateness;
to regard it as mere trifling; to view it at best as a
feeble missile from the armoury of wit, only adapted
for the "puny (query <i>punny</i>?) whipster," and
which those who are qualified to wield more va<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>luable
weapons would scarcely deign to employ.
I trust that, in the course of these introductory observations,
I shall effectually dispel all such erroneous
prejudices, and shall satisfactorily assert
the true dignity of the art, so that my readers may
join with me in exclaiming,</p>


<div class="figcenter">"<i>Punica</i> se quantis attollet gloria <i>rebus</i>!"</div>


<p>and may perceive, that it is not only venerable
from its antiquity, and supported by the authority
of persons of taste and learning, who have invariably
cultivated it, but is likewise highly beneficial
to the bodily health, moral feeling, and intellectual
improvement of the community.</p>

<p>With respect to its antiquity, we find it treated
of by the most eminent writers upon rhetoric among
the ancients, who not only class it among the beauties
of language, but have stamped it with the dignity
of a distinct figure of speech, assigning to it an
appropriate name. I make no observations upon
the injudicious attempts of some modern commentators
to ally it to the <i>paranomasia</i>, it being evidently
the <i>antanaclasis</i> of the rhetoricians. The
great Aristotle (Rhet. ch. 11.) enumerates two or
three different species of &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;, the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
he gives to puns, in his remarks upon this figure,
and cites examples of each kind, with expressions
of commendation, from some of the most celebrated
Greek authors. In Cicero's treatise on Oratory, a
variety of instances of the <i>antanaclasis</i> are quoted,
and highly praised by him for their wit. His own
puns, with which his works abound, are more distinguished
for their number than their excellence:
humour does not appear to have been his forte, but
his frequent attempts at punning sufficiently evince
the high estimation in which it was held by himself
and his contemporaries. The ancient poets, strange
as it may appear, were not, in general, adepts in
this art, if we except Aristophanes among the
Greeks, and Ovid and Martial among the Latins.
From the two last mentioned writers (the former of
whom indeed would readily furnish a cento of puns)
I beg leave to select two examples. The one is
where Ovid makes Leander say, "<span class="smcap">Posito</span> <i>cum
veste timore</i>;" the other is the well-known epigram
by Martial on the emperor Nero:</p>


<div class="figcenter">"<i>Quis negat Æneæ natum de stirpe Neronem?</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Sustulit</span> <i>hic matrem</i>, <span class="smcap">Sustulit</span> ille patrem."</div>


<p>I adduce these examples, because Addison, after
erroneously defining a pun to be merely "a conceit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
arising from the use of two words that agree in the
sound, but differ in the sense," goes on to inform us
that if translated into a different language, it will
vanish in the experiment; in fact he would represent
it as <i>vox et præterea nihil</i>, a sound, and
nothing but a sound. Unquestionably there are a
multitude of puns that might answer this description,
but it is far from being applicable to all.
In the two instances I have just brought forward,
the words <i>posito</i> and <i>sustulit</i> can be exactly translated
into English, and both the sense and the pun
retained. The truth is, that Addison, like many
more who have thought proper to be very severe on
the talents of the punning fraternity, was evidently
not very accurately acquainted with the nature of
what he was attacking.</p>

<p>If the plea of antiquity can thus be justly advanced
in favour of punning, the continued adherence
of all nations in all periods to the practice,
may likewise with reason be urged in its support.
Nor are its ramifications of slight importance. It
may be considered as the origin of technical terms,
most of which, if properly analysed, will prove to
be virtual puns or conundrums; as the parent of
<i>double entendre</i> of every description; and even as
containing the germs of that <i>slang</i> formerly con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>fined
to the lower walks of life, but, in our more
enlightened days, emulously studied even among
the Corinthian pillars of polished society.</p>

<p>The number of final letters, which among the
French are mere ciphers in pronunciation, has always
given them a decided advantage in puns of
mere words over every other nation. Their writings
and conversation are alike replete with them; but
they are almost invariably of that kind alluded to
by Addison, which are lost if clothed in any but
their native dress. Indeed this is almost a necessary
consequence of the very circumstance already alluded
to, which ensures them such superior facility
in the production of puns. A brace of these I shall
present my readers with, both as exhibiting a strong
confirmation of what I have above said, and as being
of modern date, and, in my opinion, of sterling
excellence. The first of these is the reply made by
a Parisian wit, to a person who asked him what
was the true distinction between a flea and a louse.
He answered that they were only disciples of different
philosophers: the lice being followers of
Epictetus (<i>des pique-têles</i>), and the fleas of Epicurus
(<i>des piqueurs</i>). The other is an epigram,
much talked off at the time of its appearance in the
French metropolis, written by some wag, under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
picture of Louis XVIII. painted by <i>Le Gros</i>, and
placed in one of the public exhibitions. The
striking resemblance of the head and neck of that
monarch to those of a rabbit is well known; and of
this circumstance the malicious epigrammatist thus
happily avails himself in the pasquinade referred
to:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Le Gros l'a peint! (<i>le gros lapin!</i>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Le Gros l'a peint!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Notre bon souverain.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">De la peinture admirez la magie:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Tout le monde à la fois s'écrie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Le Gros l'a peint!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Le Gros l'a peint!</span><br />
</p>

<p>As I have assumed the privilege in these remarks
of being as desultory and digressive as I
please, I shall here notice what I term <i>macaroni
punning</i>, effected by a fictitious <i>mélange</i> of different
languages. Sometimes this will arise from the inspection
of a single word. Who, for instance,
can forbear smiling at the curious orthoepical coincidence
by which an accommodating fair one is in
Latin designated <i>meretrix</i>? This, however, is the
simplest effort of the <i>macaroni</i> class, and far from
implying that ingenuity visible in higher flights of
the same kind, which are frequently conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
for their wit and pithiness. Lord Erskine's inscription
on his tea chest, <i>Tu doces</i>, is of great
merit in its way. Lord Norbury, I believe, has
the reputation of having observed, upon seeing
some young fellow vain of his personal attractions
almost in tears at contemplating the manner in
which the nocturnal attacks of a band of <i>jumpers</i>
had disfigured his face, "<i>Fle-bit</i>, he will weep."
His countryman Curran's reply to his rival counsel
Egan, will not easily be forgotten. The latter,
coming out of court, and observing on Curran's
coat a certain <i>disgrace to the poll</i>, addressed him
in the words of Virgil:</p>


<div class="figcenter">"Dic mihi, Dam&#339;ta, cujum pecus? an Melib&#339;i?"</div>


<p>Curran immediately replied by completing the
passage:</p>


<div class="figcenter">"Non, verum <span class="smcap">Ægonis</span>: nuper mihi tradidit <span class="smcap">Ægon</span>."</div>


<p>Probably, however, Swift's impromptu quotation
on seeing a Cremona violin swept off a table by a
lady's mantua:</p>


<div class="figcenter">"<i>Mantua</i>, væ! miseræ nimium vicina <i>Cremonæ</i>,"</div>


<p>will always stand at the head of puns of this class.</p>

<p>I own that I am particularly delighted with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
good <i>macaroni</i> pun. It necessarily implies, not
only superior wit, but a considerable fund of learning,
on the part of the punster. And what is still
better, it shows that this learning is free from the
rust of pedantry, tending to enliven those around
him, and not to create in him a repulsive conceit,
and a haughty estrangement from society. His
candle is not hidden under a bushel, but freely and
cheerfully dispenses its light: His treasure is not
kept in the form of useless hoarded bullion, but is
converted into a valuable circulating medium, the
coin being liberally and extensively distributed by
its owner.</p>

<p>The inmates of universities have usually been
remarked for their attachment to punning. The
men of Cambridge, in particular, have ever, from
their foundation, been distinguished by their excellence
as paragrammatists. It surely not a little
exalts this noble art, that those who have enjoyed
peculiar opportunities of justly appreciating every
thing connected both with abstruse and polite literature,
should have sedulously cultivated it. And
I think I may be allowed to say, in contradiction
to the reiterated attempts of prejudice and stupidity
to undervalue it, that I never met with a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
incapable of some degree of excellence in punning,
who was remarkable for any species of wit above
the practical jokes of a merry-andrew.</p>

<p>But it is not only on its high antiquity, its extensive
diffusion, or the distinguished authorities
that can be adduced in support of it, that the claims
of punning are founded. The philosopher who
defined man to be &#964;&#959; &#950;&#969;&#959;&#957; &#947;&#949;&#955;&#969;&#957;, certainly selected
the only characteristic besides that of speech, which
particularly and exclusively distinguishes man from
the brute creation.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"'Twas said of old, deny it now who can,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The only laughing animal is man.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The bear may leap, its lumpish cubs in view,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Or sportive cat her circling tail pursue;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The grin deep-lengthen pug's half-human face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Or prick'd up ear confess the simp'ring ass:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">In awkward gestures awkward mirth be shown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Yet, spite of gesture, man still laughs alone."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Now to the exercise of this high and distinguished
prerogative of our nature, what is a more certain
stimulant than a pun? If it be good, you laugh
at the pun; if bad, at the punster; and in either
case, he is almost certain to laugh himself. More<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>over,
the punster is one of all others, "<i>quem jocus
risusque circumvolat</i>;" not only witty himself, but
the cause of wit in others; for it is rarely, indeed,
in the social circle, that one pun is not the signal
for a series of others. The cards are generally
played after the first is led, till the suit is fairly
out.</p>

<p>But laughter is not only one of the principal faculties
which distinguish man from inferior animals;
it likewise contributes greatly to the promotion and
preservation of health. "Laugh and grow fat," is
a very old and a very wise adage.</p>

<p>And observe, the fat which thus increaseth the
ribs is wholesome, good, firm fat, bearing no resemblance
whatever to the adipose envelope of the
bloated and corpulent. Those who are clothed
with laughter-begotten fat are, moreover, in general,
of humour frank and free, cordial, cheerful,
and enterprising; as dissimilar to the indolent,
arthritic, or the selfish gourmand, as to the cadaverous,
saturnine, acetous beings who stalk about
like so many skeletons, galvanised into temporary
motion, and presenting a <i>memento mori</i> to all they
meet. And if such be the genial, the beneficial,
effects of laughter, can we laud too highly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
practice of punning, that most apt and prompt instrument
of promoting it?</p>

<p>In another point of view, too, this art doth not a
little contribute to the advancement and improvement
of moral feeling. How often have the asperities
incident to conversation been instantly softened
down by the means of a well-timed pun?
How many a rising storm of colloquial debate and
controversial wrath has been dispelled by the same
salutary agency, when wisdom would have failed
to convince, or mediation to conciliate? The able
punster has perhaps more frequent opportunities
than any other character, of securing the blessing
pronounced upon the peace-maker.</p>

<p>The pious Dr. Watts, in his Introduction to
Logic, has commented on the moral as well as
literary evils arising from the number of equivocal
and the comparative paucity of univocal words.
Now the knowledge of a disease being half its cure,
who is so likely to be exempt from the evils arising
from the above-mentioned sources as the punster?
Every fresh touch of his art may be considered as
a discovery of some more of these dangerous equivocals,
and indeed his whole life may be regarded
as a philanthropic voyage in quest of them, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>bining
the double advantage of exciting mirth by
their timely production, and affording a salutary
warning to the hearer against the employment of
such Proteus terms in grave and serious discussion.
Thus again we see the paragrammatist enabled to
contribute in a high degree to the social enjoyment,
literary improvement, and moral amelioration of
his fellow creatures.</p>

<p>If wit consists principally, as the first of modern
philosophers has affirmed, in the unexpected association
of ideas apparently far removed in their nature
from each other, punning must, in its very
essence, claim to rank in the highest class of wit.
And how must the frequent exercise of searching
for such associations, and bringing them however
recondite to light, sharpen the intellect of the individual
engaged in it! We have already adverted
to the general practice of this art among the members
of our universities; we may likewise observe
that the learned body of the law, a body distinguished
perhaps beyond any other for their superior
shrewdness, and extent of general information,
are universally partial to it. The barrister
who pleads, and the judge who directs, are alike
ambitious to display their excellence in this highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
prized art; and justice herself, though for the sake
of her character she must needs be blind, is rarely
found deaf to the sallies of the punster.</p>

<p><i>Ohe! jam satis est.</i> Sufficient, we are persuaded,
has been said to satisfy all persons of the value
and excellence of punning, except indeed the obstinately
incredulous; and such, as a just punishment,
we would excommunicate for ever from
the enjoyment of puns, and the society of punsters.
Can we pronounce a severer doom?</p>

<p>But as the best of things are the most liable to
abuses, so has the cause of punning suffered much
from the want of judgment evinced by many of its
votaries. Anxious, as far as possible, to contribute
to maintaining this noble art in the possession of
its well-merited reputation, we venture a few words
of caution to some of its professors on the errors
too frequently committed by them.</p>

<p>Imprimis, a pun, like an epigram, is worth little
indeed if the point can be anticipated. Hence
proper names, though they have in some few instances
been successfully worked upon, are in general
bad materials for the punster. The attempt
to pun upon Black, White, Green, Brown, Scott,
England, and <i>id genus omne</i>, if productive of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
laughter, is of that only which is excited by
the imbecility and empty pretensions of him who
makes it. In justice to our contemporary <span class="smcap">John
Bull</span>, we must observe that on this very dangerous
ground, he is almost the only person who has had
the singular felicity of uniformly appearing with
success.</p>

<p>For the same reason that we object to proper
names, we need scarcely observe that all trite puns
are detestable. There are a number of words,
such as <i>heart</i>, <i>love</i>, <i>soul</i>, <i>last</i>, <i>grave</i>, and a host of
others, that have been fairly worn thread-bare in
the service. Let him whose wit is not competent
to discover some other sources than these hackneyed
ones, be a listener, but by no means a speaker in a
circle of punsters. <i>Decies repetita placebit</i>, however
just it may be as the criterion of merit in a
poem, will never do for a pun, one of whose chief
excellencies is novelty,&mdash;nay, which often, however
rich at the moment of its utterance, will not successfully
admit of repetition, even to those who
have never before heard it, at another time and
under different circumstances.</p>

<p>A pun can rarely be considered very good, which
involves a difference of orthography. It appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
like a descent from its true dignity to the level of
a common conundrum.</p>

<p>Lastly, let every punster bear in mind, that
punning is only the sauce of conversation, and that
he who thinks to entertain by introducing it continually
into his discourse, resembles a man who
should present me with a dish of Cayenne pepper
alone by way of a meal. It may likewise be observed,
that what is usually called an inveterate,
is never a good punster. The constant desire of
display, by accustoming himself to be contented
with mediocrity, or something below it, almost
disqualifies him from uttering any thing above it.
We may say with justice, "a pun spoken in good
season, how good is it!" Time, and place, and
persons too, must be regarded. The punster, while
he enlivens conversation, is one of the greatest acquisitions
to a company; when he only interrupts
it, he is one of its greatest nuisances. Much more
could we add concerning both the theory and
practice of this art, but we would not willingly
become tedious. Gentle reader, whosoever thou art,
receive in good part what we have here written;
imbue thyself with such a love of punning, and
such a sense of its dignity, that thy efforts may
exalt and not degrade it: so shalt thou merit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
good wish which, with a sincere heart, we now
bestow upon thee: Mayest thou become one of the
warmest admirers of punning, and shine as one of
the first of punsters!</p>

<p>
Once on a time in merry mood,<br />
Jove made a Pun of flesh and blood:<br />
A double two-faced living creature,<br />
Androgynos, of two-fold nature,<br />
For back to back with single skin<br />
He bound the male and female in;<br />
So much alike, so near the same,<br />
They stuck as closely as their name.<br />
Whatever words the male exprest,<br />
The female turn'd them to a jest;<br />
Whatever words the female spoke,<br />
The male converted to a joke:<br />
So, in this form of man and wife<br />
They led a merry punning life.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gods from heaven descend to earth,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Drawn down by their alluring mirth;<br />
So well they seem'd to like the sport,<br />
Jove could not get them back to court.<br />
Th' infernal gods ascend as well,<br />
Drawn up by magic puns from hell.<br />
Judges and furies quit their post,<br />
And not a soul to mind a ghost.<br />
'Heyday!' says Jove: says Pluto too,<br />
'I think the Devil's here to do;<br />
Here's hell broke loose, and heaven's quite empty;<br />
We scarce have left one god in twenty.<br />
Pray what has set them all a-running?&mdash;<br />
'Dear brother, nothing else but punning.<br />
Behold that double creature yonder<br />
Delights them with a double <i>entendre</i>.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Odds-fish,' says Pluto, 'where's your thunder?</span><br />
Let's drive, and split this thing asunder!'<br />
'That's right,' quoth Jove; with that he threw<br />
A bolt, and split it into two;<br />
And when the thing was split in twain,<br />
Why then it punn'd as much again.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">''Tis thus the diamonds we refine,</span><br />
The more we cut, the more they shine;<br />
And ever since your men of wit,<br />
Until they're cut, can't pun a bit.<br />
So take a starling when 'tis young,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>And down the middle slit the tongue,<br />
With groat or sixpence, 'tis no matter,<br />
You'll find the bird will doubly chatter.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Upon the whole, dear Pluto, you know,</span><br />
'Tis well I did not slit my Juno!<br />
For, had I done't, whene'er she'd scold me,<br />
She'd make the heavens too hot to hold me.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gods, upon this application,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Return'd each to his habitation,</span><br />

<p>Your honour's character is too well known in the
world to stand in need of a dedication; but I can
tell you, that my fortune is not so well settled but
I stand in need of a patron. And therefore, since
I am to write a dedication, I must, for decency,
proceed in the usual method.</p>

<p>First, I then proclaim to the world your high
and illustrious birth: that you are, by the father's
side, descended from the most ancient and celebrated
family of Rome, the Cascas; by the mother's,
from Earl Percy. Some indeed have been
so malicious as to say, your grandmother <i>kill'd-her-kin</i>:
but, I think if the authors of the report were
found out, they ought to be <i>hampered</i>. I will
allow that the world exclaims deservedly against
your <i>mother</i>, because she is <i>no friend to the bottle</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
otherwise they would deserve a <i>firkin</i>, as having no
<i>grounds</i> for what they say. However, I do not
think it can sully your <i>fine</i> and <i>bright</i> reputation;
for the <i>credit</i> you gained at the battle of <i>Hogshed</i>,
against the Duke of <i>Burgundy</i>, who felt no <i>sham-pain</i>,
when you <i>forced</i> him to sink beneath your
power, and gave his whole army a <i>brush</i>, may in
time turn to your account; for, to my knowledge,
it put his highness upon the <i>fret</i>. This indeed
was no less <i>racking</i> to the king his master, who
found himself <i>gross-lee</i> mistaken in catching a <i>tartar</i>.
For the whole world allowed, that you brought him
a <i>peg</i> lower, by giving him the <i>parting-blow</i>, and
making all his <i>rogues in buckram</i> to <i>run</i>. Not to
mention your great <i>a-gillity</i>, though you are past
your <i>prim-age</i>; and may you never <i>lack-age</i>, with
a <i>sparkling</i> wit, and <i>brisk</i> imagination! May your
honour also <i>wear</i> long, beyond the common <i>scantling</i>
of human life, and constantly proceed in your
musical diversions of <i>pipe</i> and <i>sack-but</i>, hunting
with <i>tarriers</i>, &amp;c. and may your good humour in
saying, "<i>I am-phor-a-bottle</i>," never be lost to the
joy of all them that drink your <i>wine</i> for nothing,
and especially of,</p>

<p>The great and singular advantages of <span class="smcap">Punning</span>,
and the lustre it gives to conversation, are commonly
so little known in the world, that scarce one
man of learning in fifty, to their shame be it spoken,
appears to have the least tincture of it in his discourse.
This I can impute to nothing but that it
hath not been reduced to a <i>science</i>; and indeed
Cicero seemed long ago to wish for it, as we may
gather from his second book de Oratore<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, where
he has this remarkable passage: "Suavis autem
est et vehementer sæpe utilis jocus et facetiæ cum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ambiguitate&mdash;in quibus tu longè aliis meâ sententiâ,
Cæsar, excellis: quo magìs mihi etiam testis esse
potes, aut nullam esse artem salis, aut, si qua est,
eam nos tu potissimum docebis." "Punning is
extremely delightful, and oftentimes very profitable;
in which, as far as I can judge, Cæsar, you excel
all mankind; for which reason you may inform me,
whether there be any art of Punning; or, if there
be, I beseech you, above all things, to instruct me
in it." So much was this great man affected with
the art, and such a noble idea did he conceive of it,
that he gave Cæsar the preference to all mankind,
only on account of that accomplishment!</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Lib. ii. § liv.</p></div>

<p>Let critics say what they will, I will venture to
affirm, that Punning, of all arts and sciences, is
the most extraordinary: for all others are circumscribed
by certain bounds; but this alone is found
to have no limits, because to excel therein requires
a more extensive knowledge of all things. A Punner
must be a man of the greatest natural abilities,
and of the best accomplishments: his wit must be
poignant and fruitful, his understanding clear and
distinct, his imagination delicate and cheerful; he
must have an extraordinary elevation of soul, far
above all mean and low conceptions; and these
must be sustained with a vivacity fit to express his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
ideas, with that grace and beauty, that strength and
sweetness, which become sentiments so truly noble
and sublime.</p>

<p>And now, lest I should be suspected of imposing
upon my reader, I must entreat him to consider
how high Plato has carried his sentiments of this
art (and Plato is allowed by all men to have seen
farther into Heaven than any Heathen either before
or since). Does not he say positively, in his Cratylus,
"Jocos et Dii amant," the gods themselves
love Punning? which I am apt to believe from
Homer's &#7938;&#963;&#946;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#947;&#7953;&#955;&#969;&#962;, unextinguished laughter;
because there is no other motive could cause such
continued merriment among the gods.</p>

<p>As to the antiquity of this art, Buxtorf proves it
to be very early among the Chaldeans; which any
one may see at large, who will read what he says
upon the word &#1510;&#1497;&#1498;&#1494; Pun, Vocula est Chaldæis familiarissima,
&amp;c. "It is a word that is most frequently
in use among the Chaldeans," who were
first instructed in the methods of punning by their
magi, and gained such reputation, that Ptolemæus
Philo-punnæus sent for six of those learned priests,
to propagate their doctrine of puns in six of his
principal cities; which they did with such success,
that his majesty ordered, by public edict, to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
full collection of all the puns made within his dominions
for three years past; and this collection
filled one large apartment of his library, having
this following remarkable inscription over the door:</p>


<div class="figcenter">&#7993;&#954;&#964;&#987;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#951;&#962;,<br />

<p>Some authors, but upon what ground it is uncertain,
will have Pan, who in the Æolic dialect is
called Pun, to be the author of Puns, because, they
say, Pan being the god of universal nature, and
Punning free of all languages, it is highly probable
that it owes its first origin, as well as name, to this
god: others again attribute it to Janus, and for
this reason&mdash;Janus had two faces; and of consequence
they conjectured every word he spoke had
a double meaning. But, however, I give little
credit to these opinions, which I am apt to believe
were broached in the dark and fabulous ages of the
world; for I doubt, before the first Olympiad,
there can be no great dependence upon profane
history.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>I am much more inclined to give credit to Buxtorf;
nor is it improbable that Pythagoras, who
spent twenty-eight years at Egypt in his studies,
brought this art, together with some arcana of philosophy,
into Greece; the reason for which might
be, that philosophy and punning were a mutual
assistance to each other: "For," says he, "puns
are like so many torch-lights in the head, that give
the soul a very distinct view of those images, which
she before seemed to grope after as if she had been
imprisoned in a dungeon." From whence he looked
upon puns to be so sacred, and had such a regard
to them, that he left a precept to his disciples, forbidding
them to eat beans, because they were called
in Greek &#960;&#965;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#953;. "Let not," says he, "one grain
of the seeds be lost; but preserve and scatter them
over all Greece, that both our gardens and our
fields may flourish with a vegetable, which, on account
of its name, not only brings an honour to our
country, but, as it disperses its effluvia in the air,
may also, by a secret impulse, prepare the soul for
punning, which I esteem the first and great felicity
of life."</p>

<p>This art being so very well recommended by so
great a man, it was not long before it spread
through all Greece, and at last was looked upon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
be such a necessary accomplishment, that no person
was admitted to a feast who was not first examined,
and if he were found ignorant of punning, he was
dismissed with &#7961;&#954;&#7937;&#962; &#7953;&#987;&#949;, &#946;&#7953;&#950;&#951;&#955;&#959;&#953;, "Hence, ye profane!"</p>

<p>If any one doubts the truth of what I say, let
him consult the apophthegms of Plutarch, who,
after he had passed several encomiums upon this
art, gives some account of persons eminent in it;
among which (to shorten my preface) I choose one
of the most illustrious examples, and will entertain
the courteous reader with the following story:
"King Philip had his collar-bone broken in a
battle; and his physician expecting money of him
every visit, the king reproved him with a pun,
saying he had the key in his own hands." For the
word &#954;&#955;&#7953;&#949;&#953;&#962;, in the original, signifies both a key and
a collar-bone<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Vide Plut. Apophth. p. 177.</p></div>

<p>We have also several puns recorded in Diogenes
Laertius's "Lives of the Philosophers;" and those
made by the wisest and gravest men among them,
even by Diogenes the cynick, who, although pretending
to withstand the irresistible charms of punning,
was cursed with the name of an abhorrer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>Yet, in spite of all his ill-nature and affectation (for
he was a tub-preacher), he made so excellent a pun,
that Scaliger said, "He would rather have been
author of it, than king of Navarre." The story is
as follows: Didymus (not Didymus the commentator
upon Homer, but a famous rake among the
ladies at Athens) having taken in hand to cure a
virgin's eye that was sore, had this caution given
him by Diogenes, "Take care you do not corrupt
your pupil." The word &#954;&#8001;&#961;&#945; signifies both the
pupil of the eye and a virgin<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> See Laërtius.</p></div>

<p>It would be endless to produce all the authorities
that might be gathered, from Diodorus Siculus,
Herodotus, Proconosius, Bergæus, Dionysius Halicarnassensis,
Lycophron, Pindar, Apollonius, Menander,
Aristophanes, Corinthus Cous, Nonnus,
Demosthenes, Euripides, Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle,
&amp;c.; from every one of which I should have
produced some quotations, were it not that we are
so unfortunate in this kingdom not to have Greek
types sufficient for such an undertaking<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>: for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>want of which, I have been put to the necessity, in

to be without Greek types, this could scarcely be a serious
complaint at Dublin in 1719.</p></div>

<p>However, I believe it will not be amiss to bring
some few testimonies, to show in what great esteem
the art of punning was among the most refined wits
at Rome, and that in the most polite ages, as will
appear from the following quotations.</p>

<p>Quinctilian says<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, "Urbanitas est virtus quædam,
in breve dictum, verum sensu duplici, coacta, et
apta ad delectandos homines," &amp;c. Thus translated,
"Punning is a virtue, comprised in a short
expression, with a double meaning, and fitted to delight
the ladies."</p>

<p>But to come nearer home, and our own times;
we know that France, in the late reign, was the
seat of learning and policy; and what made it so,
but the great encouragement the king gave punners
above any other men: for it is too notorious, to
quote any author for it, that Lewis le Grand gave
a hundred pistoles for one single pun-motto, made
upon an abbot, who died in a field, having a lily
growing out of his a&mdash;:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"Habe mortem præ oculis.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.25em;">Abbé mort en prez au culiz."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Nor was his bounty less to Monsieur de Ferry
de Lageltre the painter (though the pun and the
picture turned against himself), who drew his majesty
shooting, and at some distance from him another
man aiming at the same fowl, who was withheld
by a third person, pointing at the king, with
these words from his mouth,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"Ne voyez vous le Roy tirant?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Having now, from the best authorities, plainly
proved the antiquity and excellence of the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
punning, nothing remains but to give some general
directions as to the manner how this science is to
be taught.</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Let the husband teach his wife to read it.</p>

<p>2. Let her be appointed to teach her children.</p>

<p>3. Let the head servant of the family instruct all
the rest, and that every morning before the master
and mistress are up.</p>

<p>4. The masters and misses are to repeat a rule
every day, with the examples; and every visiting-day
be brought up, to show the company what fine
memories they have.</p>

<p>5. They must go ten times through the book,
before they be allowed to aim at a pun.</p>

<p>6. They must every day of their lives repeat
six synonymous words, or words like in sound,
before they be allowed to sit down to dinner,&mdash;
such as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Assent, Ascent.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Lass, Alas.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bark,   Barque.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alter, Altar.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Peer, Appear.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Barbery, Barberrie.</span><br />
</p>

<p>They are all to be found in metre, most laboriously
compiled by the learned author of "The
English School-master," printed anno 1641, London
edit. p. 52.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>7. If any eldest son has not a capacity to attain
to this science, let him be disinherited as <i>non-compos</i>,
and the estate given to the next hopeful
child.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a remarkable passage in Petronius
Arbiter, which plainly proves, by a royal example,
that punning was a necessary ingredient to make an
entertainment agreeable. The words are these:
"Ingerebat nihilominus Trimalchio lentissima voce,
Carpe. Ego, suspicatus ad aliquam urbanitatem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>toties iteratam vocem pertinere, non erubui eum
qui supra me accumbebat hoc ipsum interrogare.
At ille qui sæpius ejusmodi ludos spectaverat,
Vides, inquit, illum qui obsonium carpit, Carpus
vocatur. Itaque quotiescunque dicit Carpe, eodem
verbo et vocat et imperat." And it is further remarkable,
that every day of his life he made the
same pun at dinner and supper.</p>

<p>Lest my modesty should be called in question,
for venturing to appear in print, in an age so famous
for politeness and ingenuity, I think I am
bound to say this in my own defence, that these
few sheets were not designed to be made public, as
being written for my own private use: but what
will not the importunity of friends conquer? they
were no sooner discovered in my study, but my
merry friend George Rochfort, my learned acquaintance
Patrick Delany, and my much honoured
patron Jonathan Swift, all unanimously agreed,
that I should do my own reputation and the world
that justice, as to send "such a treasure of knowledge"
(as they were pleased to express themselves)
to the press. As for the work itself, I may venture
to say, it is a work of time and experience, and
entirely unattempted before. For which reason, I
hope the candid reader will be favourable in his
judgment upon it, and consider that all sciences in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
their infancy have been weak and feeble. The
next age may supply where I have been defective;
and the next perhaps may produce a Sir Isaac in
punning. We know that logicians first spun out
reason in categories, predicaments, and enunciations;
and at last they came to wind up their bottoms
in syllogisms, which is the completing of that
science.</p>

<p>The Chaldeans began the mathematics, in which
the Egyptians flourished. Then these, crossing the
sea by the means of Thales the Milesian, came into
Greece, where they were improved very much by
Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, and &#338;nopides of Chios.
These were followed by Briso, Antipho, Hippocrates,
&amp;c. But the excellence of the algebraic art
was begun by Geber, an Arabian astronomer (whence
as is conceived the word <i>algebra</i> took its rise), and
was much since improved by Cardanus, Tartaglia,
Clavius, Stevinus, Ghetaldus, Herigenius, Fran.
Van Schooten, Florida de Beaune, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But to return to the Art of Punning again; the
progress and improvement of which, I hope, will be
equal to the sciences I have mentioned; or to any
superior to them, if there be such: reader, I must
trespass a little longer on your patience, and tell
you an old maxim, <i>Bonum quo communius, eo me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>lius</i>,
"Good, the more common, the better it is."
You see, I have in imitation of the industrious bee
gathered my honey from various flowers; but yet
I cannot say, without some diminution and loss to
the persons from whom I have taken the examples
to my rules, who are likely never to use their puns
again.</p>

<p>And here to avoid the imputation of ingratitude,
I must declare to the world, that my worthy friend
Dr. R&mdash;&mdash;, who is singularly remarkable for his
unparalleled skill in punning, and a most industrious
promoter of it, has been a very great instrument
in bringing this work to light, as well by animating
me to proceed in it, as by endeavouring to
procure a good letter for the impression.</p>

<p>The favourable acceptance that my puns have
met with in some private companies, makes me
flatter myself, that my labours therein will be candidly
accepted, as they have been cordially intended
to serve my native country.</p>

<p>"Punnata dicuntur, id ipsum, quod sunt, aliorum
esse dicuntur, aut alio quovis modo ad aliud
referuntur."</p>

<p>Puns, in their very nature and constitution, have
a relation to something else; or, if they have not,
any other reason why will serve as well.</p>


<p><i>The Physical Definition of Punning, according to
Cardan.</i></p>

<p>Punning is an art of harmonious jingling upon
words, which, passing in at the ears, and falling
upon the diaphragma, excites a titillary motion in
those parts; and this being conveyed by the animal
spirits into the muscles of the face, raises the cockles
of the heart.</p>


<p><i>The Moral Definition of Punning.</i></p>

<p>Punning is a virtue that most effectually promotes
the end of good fellowship, which is laughing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>N.B. I design to make the most celebrated
punners in these kingdoms examples to the following
rules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule</span> 1. The capital Rule. He that puns, must
have a head for it; that is, he must be a man of
letters, of a sprightly and fine imagination, whatever
men may think of his judgment; like Dr.
Swift<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, who said, when a lady threw down a Cremona-fiddle
with a frisk of her mantua,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">"Mantua væ miseræ nimium vicina Cremonæ!"</span><br />
</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> In the early editions of the tract, this admirable pun is
ascribed to Dr. Delany.</p></div>

<p>Or if you would have a more obvious reason, St.
Dennis never made a pun after his head was cut off.
Vid. Popish Legend, tom. lxxviii. p. 15,000.</p>

<p>R. 2. The rule of Forehead. He must have
good assurance, like my Lord B&mdash;&mdash;, who puns in
all companies.</p>

<p>R. 3. The Brazen Rule. He must have better
assurance, like Brigadier C&mdash;&mdash;, who said, 'That,
as he was passing through a street, he made to a
country fellow who had a hare swinging on a stick
over his shoulder, and, giving it a shake, asked him
whether it was his own <i>hair</i>, or a perriwig?' whereas
it is a notorious Oxford jest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>R. 4. The Rule of Impudence. He must
have the best assurance, like Dr. D&mdash;&mdash;, who,
although I had in three fair combats worsted him,
yet had the impudence to challenge me a fourth
time.</p>

<p>R. 5. Any person may pun upon another man's
puns about half an hour after he has made them;
as Dr. E&mdash;&mdash; and Mr. F&mdash;&mdash; frequently do.</p>

<p>I remember one day I was in company with
them, and upon Major G&mdash;&mdash; saying, 'That he
would leave me the gout for a legacy,' I made answer,
and told the company,' I should be sorry to
have such a <i>leg as he</i>.' They both snapped it up
in their turns, and had as much applause for the
pun as I had.</p>

<p>R. 6. The Rule of Pun upon Pun. All puns
made upon the word pun are to be esteemed as so
much old gold. <i>Ex. gr.</i> suppose two famous
punsters should contend for the superiority, and a
man should wittily say, 'That is a <i>Carthaginian</i>
war:'</p>

<blockquote><p>Q. How, sir?</p>

<p>A. Why, sir, it is a <i>Pun-ick</i> war.</p>

<p>R. 7. The Socratic Rule is, to instruct others by
way of question and answer.</p>

<p>Q. Who was the first drawer?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. Why are horses with grease in their heels the
best racers?</p>

<p>A. Because their heels are given to <i>running</i>.</p>

<p>Q. What is the reason that rats and mice are so
much afraid of base violins and fiddles?</p>

<p>A. Because they are strung with <i>cat-gut</i>.</p>

<p>Q. If a lawyer is a whig, and pretends to be
a Tory, or <i>vice versa</i>, why should his gown be
stripped off?</p>

<p>A. Because he is guilty of <i>sham-party</i>.</p>

<p>Q. How many animals are concerned in the formation
of the <i>English</i> tongue?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<p>A. According to <i>Buck</i>-anan, a great number;
viz. <i>cat-egorical</i>, <i>dog-matical</i>, <i>crow-nological</i>, <i>flea-botomy</i>,
<i>fish-ognomy</i>, <i>squirril-ity</i>, <i>rat-ification</i>,
<i>mouse-olæum</i>, <i>pus-illanimity</i>, <i>hare-editary</i>, <i>ass-tronomy</i>,
<i>jay-ography</i>, <i>stag-yrite</i>, <i>duck-tility</i>.</p>

<p>Q. Where were the first <i>hams</i> made?</p>

<p>A. They were made in the temple of <i>Jupiter
Hammon</i>, by the <i>Hamadryades</i>; one of them (if
we may depend upon <i>Baker's</i> Chronicle) was sent as
a present to a gentleman in <i>Ham-shire</i>, of the family
of the <i>Ham-iltons</i>, who immediately sent it to
<i>Ham-ton-court</i>, where it was hung up by a string
in the hall, by way of rarity, whence we have the
English phrase <i>ham-strung</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">Thus did great Socrates improve the mind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">By questions useful since to all mankind;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">For, when the purblind soul no farther saw,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Than length of nose, into dark Nature's law,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">His method clear'd up all, enlarged the sight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">And so he taught his pupils with <i>day-light</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>R. 8. The Rule of Interruption. Although the
company be engaged in a discourse of the most
serious consequence, it is and may be lawful to interrupt
them with a pun. <i>Ex. gr.</i> suppose them
poring over a problem in mathematics, you may,
without offence, ask them 'How go <i>squares</i> with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
them?' You may say too, 'That, being too intent
upon those figures, they are become <i>cycloeid</i>, i. e.
<i>sickly-eyed</i>; for which they are a pack of <i>loga-rithms</i>,
i. e. <i>loggerheads</i>.' Vide R. 34.</p>

<p>R. 9. The Rule of Risibility. A man must be
the first that laughs at his own pun; as <i>Martial</i>
advises:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">"<i>Qui studet alterius risum captare lepore,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Imprimis rictum contrahat ipse suum.</i>"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">"He that would move another man to laughter,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.75em;">Must first begin, and t'other soon comes after."</span><br />
</p>

<p>R. 10. The Rule of Retaliation obliges you, if
a man makes fifty puns, to return all, or the most
of them, in the same kind. As for instance: Sir
W&mdash;&mdash; sent me a catalogue of Mrs. Prudence's
scholars, and desired my advice as to the management
of them:</p>

<blockquote><p>Miss-Chief, the ringleader.</p>

<p>Miss-Advice, that spoils her face with paint.</p>

<p>Miss-Rule, that does every thing she is forbid.</p>

<p>Miss-Application, who has not done one letter in
her sampler.</p>

<p>Miss-Belief, who cannot say the Creed yet.</p>

<p>Miss-Call, a perfect Billingsgate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss-Fortune, that lost her grandmother's
needle.</p>

<p>Miss-Chance, that broke her leg by romping.</p>

<p>Miss-Guide, that led the young misses into the
dirt.</p>

<p>Miss-Lay'd, who left her porringer of flour and
milk where the cat got at it.</p>

<p>Miss-Management, that let all her stockings run
out at heels for want of darning.</p>

<p>For which I sent the following masters:</p>

<p>Master-Stroke, to whip them.</p>

<p>Master-Workman, to dress them.</p>

<p>Master-Ship, to rig them.</p>

<p>Master-Lye, to excuse them.</p>

<p>Master-Wort, to purge them.</p>

<p>Master-Piece, to patch them.</p>

<p>Master-Key, to lock them up.</p>

<p>Master-Pock, to mortify them.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">If these can't keep your ladies quiet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Pull down their courage with low diet.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Perhaps, dear sir, you'll think it cruel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To feed them on plain water-gruel;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But take my word, the best of breeding!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">As it is plain, requires plain feeding.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;"><i>Vide Roscommon.</i></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>R. 11. The Rule of Repetition: You must
never let a pun be lost, but repeat and comment
upon it till every one in the company both hears
and understands it; <i>ex. gr.</i> Sir, I have good wine
to give you; excellent <i>pontack</i>, which I got <i>'pon
tick</i>; but, sir, we must have a little <i>pun-talk</i> over
it; you take me, sir, and you, and you too, madam.&mdash;There
is <i>pun-talk</i> upon <i>pontack</i>, and <i>'pon tick</i>
too, hey.</p>

<p>R. 12. The Elementary Rule. Keep to your
<i>elements</i>, whether you have <i>fish</i>, <i>fowl</i>, or <i>flesh</i>, for
dinner: As for instance, Is not this <i>fish</i> which Mr.
<i>Pool</i> sent me, <i>ex-stream</i> sweet? I think it is <i>main</i>
good, what say you? O' my <i>sole</i>, I never tasted
better, and I think it ought to take <i>plaice</i> of any
that <i>swims</i>: though you may <i>carp</i> at me for saying
so, I can assure you that both Dr. <i>Spratt</i> and Dr.
<i>Whaley</i> are of my mind.&mdash;This is an excellent
<i>fowl</i>, and a fit dish for <i>high-flyers</i>. Pray, sir,
what is your <i>o-pinion</i> of this <i>wing</i>? As for the
<i>leg</i>, the cook ought to be <i>clapper-clawed</i> for not
roasting it enough. But, now I think of it, why
should this be called the bird of Bacchus? A.
Because it was dressed by your drunken cook. Not
at all. You mistake the matter. Pray is it not a
<i>grape-lover</i>; i. e. <i>grey plover</i>? Are you for any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of this mutton, Sir? If not, I can tell you, that
you ought to be <i>lamb-asted</i>; for you must know
that I have the best in the country. My <i>sheep</i>
bear away the <i>bell</i>, and I can assure you that, all
<i>weathers</i>, I can treat my friends with as good
<i>mutton</i> as this: he that cannot make a meal of it,
ought to have it <i>ram-med</i> down his throat.</p>

<p>R. 13. The Rule of Retrospection. By this
you may recall a discourse that has been past two
hours, and introduce it thus: 'Sir, as you were
saying two hours ago&mdash;you bought those stockings
in Wales; I believe it, for they seem to be <i>well-chose</i>,
i. e. <i>Welsh-hose</i>.'&mdash;'Sir, you were saying, if
I mistake not, an hour or two ago, that soldiers
have the speediest justice. I agree with you in
that; for they are never without <i>red-dress</i>.'</p>

<p>R. 14. The Rule of Transition; which will serve
to introduce any thing that has the most remote
relation to the subject you are upon; <i>ex. gr.</i> If a
man puns upon a <i>stable</i>, you may pun upon a <i>cornfield</i>,
a <i>meadow</i>, a <i>horse-park</i>, a <i>smith's</i> or <i>sadler's
shop</i>; <i>ex. gr.</i> One says, His horses are gone to
<i>rack</i>.' Then you answer, 'I would turn out the
rascal that looks after them. <i>Hay</i>, sir, don't you
think I am right? I would <i>strike while the iron is
hot</i>; and <i>pummel</i> the dog to some purpose.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>R. 15. The Rule of Alienation; which obliges
you, when people are disputing hotly upon a subject,
to pitch upon that word which gives the
greatest disturbance, and make a pun upon it.
This has not only occasioned peace in private companies,
but has put a stop to hot wranglings in
parliaments and convocations, which otherwise
would not so soon come to a resolution: for, as
Horace says, <i>Ridiculum acri</i>, &amp;c.; and very often it
is found so. Sir &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; once, in parliament,
brought in a bill which wanted some amendment;
which being denied him by the house, he frequently
repeated, 'That he thirsted to mend his bill.'
Upon which, a worthy member got up, and said,
'Mr. Speaker, I humbly move, since that member
<i>thirsts</i> so very much, that he may be allowed to
mend his <i>draught</i>.' This put the house into such
a good humour, that his petition was granted.</p>

<p>R. 16. The Rule of Analogy is, when two persons
pun upon different subjects, after the same manner.
Ay, says one, 'I went to my <i>shoe-maker's</i> to-day
for a pair of <i>shoes</i> which I bespoke a month ago;
and when <i>all</i> came to <i>all</i>, the dog <i>bristles</i> up to me
with a thousand excuses, that I thought there
would never be an <i>end</i> of his discourse: but, upon
my calling him a rascal, he began to <i>wax</i> warm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and had the impudence to bid me to <i>vamp</i> off, for
he had not leisure now to talk to me, because he
was going to dinner: which vexed me indeed to the
very <i>sole</i>. Upon this I jumped out of his shop in
a great rage, and wished the next bit he eat might
be his <i>last</i>.' Says another, 'I went to a <i>tanner's</i>
that owed me some money; and (would you think
it?) the <i>pitiful</i> fellow was <i>fleshed</i> at it, insomuch
that forsooth he could not <i>hide</i> his resentment, but
told me, that it was enough to set a man <i>horn</i> mad
to be <i>dunned</i> so early in a morning: and, as for
his part, he would <i>curry</i> favour no longer with me,
let me do my worst. Thus the unmannerly cur
<i>barked</i> at me, &amp;c.'</p>

<p>R. 17. The Sophistical Rule is, fixing upon a
man's saying which he never spoke, and making
a pun upon it, as, 'Ay, sir, since you say he was
born in <i>Bark-shire</i>, I say he is a <i>son of a bitch</i>.'</p>

<p>R. 18. The Rule of Train, is a method of introducing
puns which we have studied before;
<i>ex. gr.</i> By talking of <i>Truelock</i> the <i>gun-smith</i>, his
very name will provoke some person in the company
to pun. Then you proceed: 'Sir, <i>I smell powder</i>,
but you are plaguy weak in your <i>mainspring</i> for
punning; I would advise you to get a better <i>stock</i>,
before you pretend to <i>let off</i>: though you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
think yourself <i>prime</i> in this art, you are much
mistaken, for a very young beginner may be a
<i>match</i> for you. Ay, sir, you may <i>cock</i> and look
big; but, <i>u-pan</i> my word, I take you to be no
more than a <i>flash</i>; and Mrs. Skin-<i>flint</i>, my neighbour,
shall pun with you for a <i>pistole</i>, if I do not
<i>lose my aim</i>, &amp;c.'</p>

<p>R. 19. The Rule of Challenge. As for instance,
when you have conned over in your mind a chain
of puns, you surprise the best punner in company,
after this manner: 'Say <i>Tan-pit</i>, if you dare.'</p>

<p>R. 20. The Sanguine Rule allows you to swear
a man out of his pun, and prove yourself the author
of it; as Dr. S&mdash;served Capt. W&mdash;, who was told
how a <i>slater</i>, working at his house, fell through all
the rafters from top to bottom, and that upon this
accident he said, 'He loved to see a man <i>go
cleverly through his work</i>.' 'That is mine, by
&mdash;,' said the Doctor.</p>

<p>R. 21. The Rule of Concatenation is making
a string of puns as fast as you can, that nobody
else can put in a word till you have exhausted the
subject; <i>ex. gr.</i> There was one <i>John Appleby</i>,
a <i>gardener</i>, fell in love with one Mrs. <i>Curran</i>, for
her <i>cherrycheeks</i> and her <i>lily</i> white hand; and
soon after he got her consent to <i>graft</i> upon her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
<i>stock</i>. Mr. <i>Link</i> the parson was sent for, who
joined the loving <i>pair</i> together; Mr. <i>Rowintree</i>
and Mr. <i>Holy-oak</i> were bride-men. The company
were, my lady <i>Joan Keel</i>, who <i>came-a-mile</i> on foot
to compliment them; and her maid <i>Sally</i>, remarkable
for her <i>carrots</i>, that rid upon a <i>chestnut</i>.
There was Dr. <i>Burrage</i> too, a constant <i>medlar</i> in
other people's affairs. He was lately <i>im-peach'd</i> for
murdering Don <i>Quick-set</i>. Mrs. <i>Lettice Skirret</i>
and Mrs. <i>Rose-merry</i> were the bride-maids; the
latter sang a song to oblige the company, which an
arch wag called a funeral dirge: but, notwithstanding
this, our friend <i>John</i> began to thrive upon
matrimony like a <i>twig in a bush</i>. I forgot to tell
you, that the tailor had so much <i>cabbage</i> out of the
wedding suit, there was none at all for supper.</p>

<p>R. 22. The Rule of Inoculating is, when a
person makes an excellent pun, and you immediately
fix another upon it; as Dean Swift one day
said to a gentleman, who had a very little bob
wig, 'Sir, the <i>dam</i> of your wig is a <i>whisker</i>;' upon
which I came in very <i>à propos</i>, and said, 'Sir,
that cannot be, for it is but an <i>ear-wig</i>.'</p>

<p>R. 23. The Rule of Desertion allows you to
bring a man into a pun, and leave him to work it
out: as, suppose you should hear a man say the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
word <i>incomparable</i>&mdash;&mdash;Then you proceed, <i>in-com-incom-par-par-rable-rable</i>&mdash;&mdash;So
let the other
make his best of it.</p>

<p>R. 24. The Salick Rule is, a pretence to a
jumping of wits: that is, when a man has made
a good pun, the other swears with a pun he was
just coming out with it. One night, I remember,
Mr.&mdash;&mdash; served Dr.&mdash;&mdash; so. The former saying
over a bottle, 'Will, I am for my mistress here.'
'How so?' says Tom. 'Why, I am for <i>Wine-if-red</i>.'
'By this <i>crooked stick</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>,' said Tom, 'I was
coming out with it.'</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> <i>Cane-a-wry</i>, <i>i. e.</i> Canary.</p></div>

<p>R. 25. The Etymological Rule is, when a man
hunts a pun through every letter and syllable of
a word: as for example, I am asked, 'What is
the best word to spend an evening with?' I answered,
'<i>Potatos</i>; for there is <i>po&mdash;pot&mdash;pota&mdash;potat&mdash;potato</i>,
and the reverse <i>sot-a-top</i>.'</p>

<p>R. 26. The Rule of Mortification is, when a man
having got the thanks and laugh of a company for
a good pun, an enemy to the art swears he read
it in "Cambridge Jests." This is such an inversion
of it, that I think I may be allowed to make
examples of these kind of people in verse:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Thus puppies, that adore the dark,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Against bright Cynthia howl and bark;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Although the regent of the night,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Like us, is gay with borrow'd light.</span><br />
</p>

<p>R. 27. The Professionary Rule<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is, to frame a
story, and swear you were present at an event
where every man talked in his own calling; <i>ex. gr.</i>
Major&mdash;&mdash; swears he was present at the seizing of
a pick-pocket by a great rabble in Smithfield; and
that he heard</p>

<blockquote><p>A Tailor say, 'Send the dog to <i>hell</i>.'</p>

<p>The Cook, 'Let me be at him, I'll <i>baste</i> him.'</p>

<p>The Joiner, 'It is <i>plain</i> the dog was caught in
the fact; I <i>saw</i> him.'</p>

<p>The Blacksmith, 'He is a fine <i>spark</i> indeed!'</p>

<p>The Butcher, <i>'Knock down</i> the <i>shambling</i> cur.'</p>

<p>The Glazier, 'Make the <i>light shine through
him</i>.'</p>

<p>The Bookseller, '<i>Bind him</i> over.'</p>

<p>The Sadler, '<i>Pummel</i> him.'</p>

<p>The Farmer, '<i>Thrash</i> the dog.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p><p>A Popish Priest going by, 'I'll make the <i>Devil
fly out of him</i>.'</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> An improvement on this rule was adopted by Dr. Swift,
in his "Full and True Account of Wood's Procession to
the Gallows."</p></div>

<p>R. 28. The Brazen-head Rule is, when a punster
stands his ground against a whole company, though
there is not one to side with him, to the utter destruction
of all conversation but his own. As for
instance&mdash;says one, 'I hate a <i>pun</i>.'&mdash;Then he,
'When a <i>pun is meant</i>, is it a <i>punishment</i>?'&mdash;'Deuce
take your quibbling!'&mdash;'Sir, I will not
bate you an <i>ace</i>, <i>cinque</i> me if I do; and I'll make
you know that I am a <i>sice</i> above you.'&mdash;'This
fellow cannot talk out of his <i>element</i>.'&mdash;'To divert
you was <i>all I meant</i>.'</p>

<p>R. 29. The Hypothetic Rule is, when you suppose
things hardly consistent to be united, for the
sake of a pun: as for instance&mdash;suppose a person
in the pillory had received a full discharge of eggs
upon every part of his face but the handle of it;
why should he make the longest verses in the
world? Ans. <i>Versos Alexandrinos</i>, <i>i. e.</i> All-eggs-and-dry-nose.</p>

<p>R. 30. The Rule of Naturalization is, that punning
is free of all languages: as for the Latin
<i>Romanos</i> you may say 'Roman nose'&mdash;<i>Temeraria</i>,
'Tom, where are you?'&mdash;<i>Oxoniæ prospectus</i>, 'Pox
on you, pray speak to us. For the French <i>quelque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
chose</i>, you may say in English 'kick shoes.' When
one says of a thief, 'I wish he was transported;'
answer, 'he is already <i>fur</i> enough.' Dr. Swift
made an excellent advantage of this rule one night:
when a certain peevish gentleman in his company
had lost his <i>spectacles</i>, he bid him 'have a good
heart, for, if it continued raining all night, he would
find them in the morning.'&mdash;'Pray, how so?'&mdash;'Why,
sir,</p>

<div class="figcenter">'Nocte pluit tota, redeunt <i>spectacula</i> manè.'</div>

<p>R. 31. The Rule of Random. When a man
speaks any thing that comes uppermost, and some
good pun-finder discovers what he never meant in
it, then he is to say, 'You have hit it!' As Major
Grimes did: complaining that he staid at home by
reason of an issue in a leg, which was just beginning
to run, he was answered by Mr.&mdash;, 'I wonder that
you should be confined who have such running legs.'
The Major replied, 'You have hit it; for I meant
<i>that</i>.'</p>

<p>R. 32. The Rule of Scandal. Never to speak
well of another punster; <i>ex. gr.</i> 'Who, he! Lord,
sir, he has not sense enough to play at crambo;' or
'He does not know the meaning of synonymous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
words;' or, 'He never rose so high as a conundrum
or a carrywhichit.'</p>

<p>R. 33. The Rule of Catch is, when you hear a
man conning a pun softly to himself, to whip it out
of his mouth, and pass it upon the company for
your own: as for instance; mustard happened to
be mentioned in company where I was, and a gentleman
with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling, was at
<i>Mus&mdash;mus, sinapi&mdash;sinapi&mdash;snap eye&mdash;bite nose</i>;&mdash;One
in the company, over-hearing him, <i>bit</i> him,
and <i>snapped</i> it up, and said, 'Mustard is the stoutest
seed in the world, for it takes the greatest man by
the <i>nose</i>.'</p>

<p>R. 34. The Golden Rule allows you to change
one syllable for another; by this, you may either
lop off, insert, or add to a word; <i>ex. gr.</i></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Church&mdash;<i>Kirk</i>.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Bangor&mdash;<i>Clangor</i>.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Presbyter&mdash;<i>Has-biter</i>.</span><br /></p>

<p>This rule is of such consequence, that a man was
once tried for his life by it. The case was thus:
A certain man was brought before a judge of assize
for murder: his lordship asked his name, and being
answered <i>Spillman</i>, the judge said, 'Take away
<i>Sp</i>, and his name is <i>Ill-man</i>; put <i>K</i> to it, and it
is <i>Killman</i>: away with him, gaoler; his very name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
has hanged him<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.' This 34th rule, on this occasion,
became a rule of court, and was so well
liked, that a justice of peace, who shall be nameless,
applied every tittle of it to a man brought to him
upon the same account, after this manner: 'Come,
sir, I conjure you, as I am one of his majesty's
justices of the peace, to tell me your name.'&mdash;'My
name, an't please you, is <i>Watson</i>.'&mdash;'O ho, sir!
<i>Watson</i>! mighty well! Take away <i>Sp</i> from it, and
it is <i>Ill-man</i>, and put <i>K</i> to it, and it is <i>Kill-man</i>:
away with him, constable, his very name will hang
him.'</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> A presbyterian preacher of the last age chose to exemplify
the Golden Rule, by dissecting the name of the great
enemy of mankind: 'Take away D, and it is <i>Evil</i>, take
away the E, and it is <i>Vile</i>, take away the V, and it is <i>Ill</i>&mdash;<i>Ill,
Vile, Evil, Devil</i>.'</p></div>

<p>Let us now consider a new case; as for instance,
'The church of England, as by law established.'
Put a <i>T</i> before it, and it is <i>Test-ablished</i>: take
away the <i>Test</i> and put in <i>o</i>, and it is <i>Abolished</i>.</p>

<p>How much was Tom Gordon, the late ingenious
author of Parson Alberoni, obliged to it, in that
very natural story which he framed concerning the
preacher, where he tells you, one of the congregation
called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>



 the minister an <i>Humbassandor</i> for an Ambassador<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The story here alluded to is told in a pamphlet, entitled,
'A modest Apology for Parson Alberoni, Governor to King
Philip, a Minor, and universal Curate of the whole Spanish
Monarchy, &amp;c. by Thomas Gordon, Esq. 1719,' and is as
follows: 'There is, in a certain diocese in this nation, a
living worth about six hundred pounds a-year. This, and
two or three more preferments, maintain the doctor in becoming
ease and corpulency. He keeps a chariot in town,
and a journeyman in the country; his curate and his coach-horses
are his equal drudges, saving that the four-legged
cattle are better fed, and have sleeker cassocks, than his
spiritual dray-horse. The doctor goes down once a-year,
to shear his flock and fill his pockets, or, in other words, to
receive the wages of his embassy; and then, sometimes in
an afternoon, if his belly do not happen to be too full, he
vouchsafes to mount the pulpit, and to instruct his people in
the greatness of his character and dullness. This composes
the whole parish to rest; but the doctor one day denouncing
himself <i>the Lord's Ambassador</i> with greater fire and loudness
than could have been reasonably expected from him, it roused
a clown of the congregation, who waked his next neighbour
with, 'Dost hear, Tom, dost hear?'&mdash;'Ay,' says Tom,
yawning, 'what does he say?'&mdash;'Say?' answered the other,
'he says a plaguy lie, to be sure; he says as how he is my
Lord's <i>Humbassandor</i>, but I think he is more rather the
Lord's Receiver-General, for he never comes but to take
money.' Six hundred pounds a-year is, modestly speaking,
a competent fee for lulling the largest congregation in
England asleep once in a twelvemonth. Such tithes are the
price of napping; and such mighty odds are there between
a curtain lecture and a cushion lecture.' See the collection
of Tracts by Gordon and Trenchard, vol. i. p. 130.</p></div>

<p>Give me leave, courteous reader, to recommend
to your perusal and practice this most excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>rule, which is of such universal use and advantage
to the learned world, that the most valuable discoveries,
both as to antiquities and etymologies, are
made by it; nay, further, I will venture to say,
that all words which are introduced to enrich and
make a language copious, beautiful, and harmonious,
arise chiefly from this rule. Let any man
but consult Bentley's Horace, and he will see what
useful discoveries that very learned gentleman has
made by the help of this rule; or, indeed, poor
Horace would have lain under the eternal reproach
of making 'a <i>fox</i> eat <i>oats</i>,' had not the learned
doctor, with great judgment and penetration, found
out <i>nitedula</i> to be a blunder of the librarians for
<i>vulpecula</i>; which <i>nitedula</i>, the doctor says, signifies
a <i>grass-mouse</i>, and this clears up the whole matter,
because it makes the story hang well together: for
all the world knows, that weazles have a most
tender regard and affection to grass mice, whereas
they hate foxes as they do fire-brands. In short,
all various lections are to be attributed to this rule:
so are all the Greek dialects; or Homer would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
have wanted the sonorous beauty of his oio's. But
the greatest and best masters of this rule, without
dispute, were the Dorians, who made nothing of
saying <i>tin</i> for <i>soie</i>, <i>tenos</i> for <i>ekeinos</i>, <i>surisdomes</i> for
<i>surizomen</i>, &amp;c. From this too we have our <i>quasis</i>
in Lexicons. Was it not, by rule the 34th, that
the Samaritan, Chaldee, Æthiopic, Syriac, Arabic,
and Persian languages were formed from the original
Hebrew? for which I appeal to the Polyglot.
And among our modern languages, are not the
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French, derived
and formed from the Latin by the same power?
How much poets have been obliged to it, we need
no further proof than the figures <i>prothesis</i>, <i>epenthesis</i>,
<i>apocope</i>, <i>paragoge</i>, and <i>ellipsis</i>. Trimming
and fitting of words to make them more agreeable
to our ears, Dionysius Halicarnassensis has taken
notice of, in his book 'De Compositione Vocum,'
where he pleasantly compares your polite reformers
of words to masons with hammers, who break off
rugged corners of stones, that they may become
more even and firm in their places.</p>

<p>But after all, give me leave to lament, that I
cannot have the honour of being the sole inventor
of this incomparable rule: though I solemnly protest,
upon the word of an author (if an author may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
have credit), that I never had the least hint toward
it, any more than the ladies' letters and young
children's pronunciation, till a year after I had
proposed this rule to Dr.&mdash;&mdash;, who was an excellent
judge of the advantage it might be to the
public; when, to my great surprise, tumbling over
the third tome of Alstedius, p. 71, right loth to believe
my eyes, I met with the following passage:
"Ambigua multam faciunt ad hanc rem, oujusmodi
exempla plurima reperiuntur apud Plautum, qui in
ambiguis crebro ludit. Joci captantur ex permutatione
syllabarum et vocum, ut pro <i>De</i>cretum,
<i>Dis</i>cretum; pro <i>Me</i>dicus, <i>Men</i>dicus et <i>Mer</i>dicus:
pro Poly<i>carpus</i>, Poly<i>eopros</i>. Item ex syllabarum
ellipsi, ut ait Althusisus, cap. iii. civil. convers. pro
Casimirus, <i>J'rus</i>; pro Marcus, <i>Arcus</i>; pro Vinosus,
<i>Osus</i>; pro Sacerdotium, <i>Otium</i>. Sic, additione literæ,
pro Urbanus, <i>Turbanus</i>:" which exactly
corresponded to every branch and circumstance of
my rule. Then, indeed, I could not avoid breaking
out into the following exclamations, and that after
a most pathetic manner: "Wretched Tom Pun-Sibi!
Wretched indeed! Are all thy nocturnal
lucubrations come to this? Must another, for being
a hundred years before thee in the world, run away
with the glory of thy own invention? It is true, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
must. Happy Alstedius! who, I thought, would
have stood me in <i>all-stead</i>, upon consulting thy
method of joking! <i>All's tedious</i> to me now, since
thou hast robbed me of that honour which would
have set me above all writers of the present age.
And why not, happy Tom Pun-Sibi? did we not
jump together like true wits? But, alas! thou art
on the safest side of the bush; my credit being
liable to the suspicion of the world, because you
wrote before me. Ill-natured critics, in spite of all
my protestations, will condemn me, right or wrong,
for a plagiary. Henceforward never write any thing
of thy own; but pillage and trespass upon all that
ever wrote before thee: search among dust and
moths for things new to the learned. Farewell,
study; from this moment I abandon thee: for,
wherever I can get a paragraph upon any subject
whatsoever ready done to my hand, my head shall
have no further trouble than see it fairly transcribed!"&mdash;And
this method, I hope, will help me to swell
out the Second Part of this work.</p>

in 1719, immediately reprinted in London, and then pretty
generally ascribed to Dr. Swift. It appears, however, that
in this instance the Dean was only an assistant; the piece
having been written by Dr. Sheridan, and corrected and improved
by Dr. Swift, Dr. Delany, and Mr. Rochfort. Although
it does not seem calculated to give offence to any one,
it however called forth the above Satire from the pen of
Dr. Tisdal.</p></div>

<p>Tom Ashe died last night. It is conceived he
was so puffed up by my lord lieutenant's <i>favour</i>,
that it struck him into a <i>fever</i>. I here send you
his dying speech, as it was exactly taken by a
friend in short-hand. It is something long, and
a little incoherent; but he was several hours delivering
it, and with several intervals. His friends
were about the bed, and he spoke to them thus:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My Friends,</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is time for a man to look <i>grave</i>, when he has
one foot there. I once had only a <i>pun</i>nic fear of
death; but of late I have <i>pun</i>dred it more seriously.
Every fit of <i>coughing</i> hath put me in mind of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span><i>coffin</i>; though <i>dissolute</i> men seldomest think of <i>dissolution</i>.
This is a very great alteration: I, that
supported myself with good <i>wine</i>, must now be
myself supported by a <i>small bier</i>. A fortune-teller
once looked on my hand, and said, 'This man is
to be a great traveller; he will soon be at the <i>Diet</i>
of <i>Worms</i>, and from thence go to <i>Ratisbone</i>.' But
now I understand his double meaning. I desire to
be privately <i>buried</i>, for I think a public funeral
looks like <i>Bury</i> fair; and the <i>rites</i> of the dead too
often prove <i>wrong</i> to the living. Methinks the
word itself best expresses the number, neither <i>few
nor all</i>. A dying man should not think of <i>obsequies</i>,
but <i>ob se quies</i>. Little did I think you would so
soon see poor <i>Tom stown</i> under a <i>tomb stone</i>. But
as the <i>mole</i> crumbles the <i>mould</i> about her, so a man
of small <i>mould</i>, before I am <i>old</i>, may <i>moulder</i> away.
Sometimes I've <i>rav'd</i> that I should <i>rev</i>ive; but
physicians tell me, that, when once the great <i>artery</i>
has drawn the <i>heart awry</i>, we shall find the <i>cor di
all</i>, in spite of all the highest <i>cordial</i>. Brother,
you are fond of <i>Daffy's</i> elixir: but, when death
comes, the world will see that, in spite of <i>Daffy
down Dilly</i>, whatever doctors <i>may design</i> by their
<i>medicines</i>, a man in a <i>dropsy drops he</i> not, in spite
of Goddard's <i>drops</i>, though none are reckoned such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span><i>high drops</i>?&mdash;I find death smells the blood of an
Englishman: a <i>fee</i> faintly <i>fum</i>bled out will be a
weak defence against his <i>fee-fa-fum</i>.&mdash;<i>$1.$2.</i> are no
letters in death's <i>alphabet</i>; he has not <i>half a bit</i> of
either: he moves his <i>scythe</i>, but will not be moved
by all our <i>sighs</i>. Every thing ought to put us in
mind of death. Physicians affirm, that our very
food breeds it in us; so that in our <i>dieting</i>, we may
be said to <i>di eating</i>. There is something ominous,
not only in the names of diseases, as <i>di</i>-arrh&#339;a, <i>di</i>-abetes,
<i>di</i>-sentery, but even in the drugs designed
to preserve our lives; as <i>di</i>-acodium, <i>di</i>-apente, <i>di</i>-ascordium.
I perceive Dr. <i>Howard</i> (and I feel
<i>how hard</i>) <i>lay thumb</i> on my <i>pulse</i>, then <i>pulls</i> it
back, as if he saw <i>lethum</i> in my face. I see as bad
in his; for sure there is no <i>physic</i> like a <i>sick phiz</i>.
He thinks I shall <i>decease</i> before the <i>day cease</i>;
but, before I die, before the bell hath <i>toll'd</i>, and
<i>Tom Tollman</i> is <i>told</i> that little <i>Tom</i>, though not
<i>old</i>, has paid nature's <i>toll</i>, I do desire to give some
advice to those that survive me. First, let gamesters
consider that death is <i>hazard</i> and <i>passage</i>,
upon the turn of a <i>die</i>. Let lawyers consider it
as a hard <i>case</i>. And let punners consider how
hard it is to <i>die jesting</i>, when death is so hard in
<i>digesting</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>
<p>As for my lord-lieutenant the Earl of <i>Mungomerry</i>,
I am sure he <i>be-wales</i> my misfortune;
and it would move him to stand by, when the carpenter
(while my friends grieve and make an <i>odd
splutter</i>) <i>nails</i> up my coffin. I will make a short
<i>affidavi</i>-t, that, if he makes my <i>epitaph</i>, I will take
it for a great honour; and it is a plentiful subject.
His excellency may say, that the art of punning is
dead with <i>Tom</i>. <i>Tom</i> has taken all puns away
with him. <i>Omne tulit pun-Tom.</i>&mdash;&mdash;May his excellency
long <i>live tenant</i> to the queen in <i>Ireland</i>.
We never <i>Herberd</i> so good a governor before.
Sure he <i>mun-go-merry</i> home, that has made a kingdom
so happy. I hear, my friends design to publish
a collection of my puns. Now I do confess, I have
let many a <i>pun go</i>, which did never <i>pungo</i>; therefore
the world must read the bad as well as the
good. Virgil has long foretold it: <i>Punica mala
leges</i>.&mdash;&mdash;I have had several forebodings that I
should soon die: I have of late been often at committees,
where I have sat de <i>die</i> in <i>diem</i>.&mdash;&mdash;I conversed
much with the <i>usher</i> of the <i>black rod</i>: I saw
his <i>medals</i>; and woe is <i>me dull</i> soul, not to consider
they are but dead men's faces <i>stampt over</i>
and <i>over</i> by the living, which will shortly be my
condition.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>Tell Sir <i>Anthony Fountain</i>, I <i>ran</i> clear to the
<i>bottom</i>, and wish he may be a late <i>a river</i> where I
am going. He used to <i>brook</i> compliments. May
his <i>sand</i> be long a <i>running</i>; not <i>quick sand</i> like
mine! Bid him avoid <i>poring</i> upon monuments and
books; which is in reality but <i>running</i> among
<i>rocks</i> and <i>shelves</i>, to <i>stop</i> his <i>course</i>. May his
<i>waters</i> never be <i>troubled</i> with <i>mud</i> or <i>gravel</i>, nor
<i>stopt</i> by any <i>grinding stone</i>! May his friends be
all true <i>trouts</i>, and his enemies laid as flat as
<i>flounders</i>! I look upon him as the most <i>fluent</i> of
his <i>race</i>; therefore let him not <i>despond</i>. I foresee
his black <i>rod</i> will advance to a <i>pike</i>, and destroy
all our <i>ills</i>.</p>

<p>But I am going; my <i>wind in</i> lungs is turning
to a <i>winding</i> sheet. The thoughts of <i>a pall</i> begin
to <i>a pall</i> me. Life is but a <i>vapour</i>, car elle <i>va
pour</i> la moindre cause. Farewell: I have lived
ad amicorum <i>fastidium</i>, and now behold how <i>fast I
dium</i>!</p>

<p>Here his breath failed him, and he expired.
There are some false spellings here and there; but
they must be pardoned in a dying man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>You must give me leave to complain of a <i>pestilent</i>
fellow in my neighbourhood, who is always
beating <i>mortar</i>; yet I cannot find he ever builds.
In talking, he useth such hard words, that I want
a Drugger-man to interpret them. But all is not
gold that <i>glisters</i>. <i>A pot he carries</i> to most houses
where he visits. He makes his prentice his <i>gally</i>

he pretends to be a <i>cordial</i> man. Every <i>spring</i>
his shop is crowded with country-folks, who, by their

of mischief. He is full of <i>scruples</i>; and so very
litigious, that he <i>files bills</i> against all his acquaintance:
and, though he be much troubled

<p>Madam Johnson has been very ill-used by her
servants; they put <i>shillings</i> into her broth instead
of <i>groats</i>, which made her stamp. I hear they

<span style="margin-left: 15.5em;"><small>TO THIS CRYING SIN IN COURT AND TOWN.</small></span><br /></p>



<p>Manifold have been the judgments which Heaven,
from time to time, for the chastisement of a sinful
people, has inflicted on whole nations. For when
the degeneracy becomes common, 'tis but just the
punishment should be general: Of this kind, in
our own unfortunate country, was that destructive
pestilence, whose mortality was so fatal, as to sweep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
away, if Sir William Petty may be believed, five
millions of Christian souls, besides women and
Jews.</p>

<p>Such also was that dreadful conflagration ensuing,
in this famous metropolis of London, which
consumed, according to the computation of Sir
Samuel Morland, 100,000 houses, not to mention
churches and stables.</p>

<p>Scarce had this unhappy nation recovered these
funest disasters, when the abomination of playhouses
rose up in this land: from hence hath an
inundation of obscenity flowed from the court and
overspread the kingdom. Even infants disfigured
the walls of holy temples with exorbitant representations
of the members of generation: nay, no
sooner had they learnt to spell, but they had wickedness
enough to write the names thereof in large
capitals: an enormity observed by travellers to be
found in no country but England.</p>

<p>But when whoring and popery were driven hence
by the happy Revolution, still the nation so greatly
offended, that Socinianism, Arianism, and Whistonism
triumphed in our streets, and were in a
manner become universal.</p>

<p>And yet still, after all these visitations, it has
pleased Heaven to visit us with a contagion more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
epidemical, and of consequence more fatal: this
was foretold to us, first, by that unparalleled
eclipse in 1714; secondly, by the dreadful coruscation
in the air this present year; and, thirdly,
by the nine comets seen at once over Soho-square,
by Mrs. Katherine Wadlington, and others: a
contagion that first crept in among the first quality,
descended to their footmen, and infused itself into
their ladies&mdash;I mean the woeful practice of PUNNING.
This does occasion the corruption of our
language, and therein of the word of God translated
into our language, which certainly every
sober Christian must tremble at.</p>

<p>Now such is the enormity of this abomination,
that our very nobles not only commit punning over
tea, and in taverns, but even on the Lord's day,
and in the king's chapel: therefore, to deter men
from this evil practice, I shall give some true and
dreadful examples of God's revenge against punsters.</p>

<p>The Right Honourable&mdash;&mdash;(but it is not
safe to insert the name of an eminent nobleman in
this paper, yet I will venture to say that such a one
has been <i>seen</i>; which is all we can say, considering
the largeness of his sleeves)&mdash;This young nobleman
was not only a flagitious punster himself, but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
accessary to the punning of others, by consent, by
provocation, by connivance, and by defence of the
evil committed; for which the Lord mercifully
spared his neck, but as a mark of reprobation
<i>wryed his nose</i>.</p>

<p>Another nobleman of great hopes, no less guilty
of the same crime, was made the punisher of himself
with his own hand, in the loss of 500 pounds at
box and dice; whereby this unfortunate young
gentleman incurred the heavy displeasure of his
aged grandmother.</p>

<p>A third of no less illustrious extraction, for the
same vice, was permitted to fall into the arms of a
<i>Dalilah</i>, who may one day cut off his curious hair,
and deliver him up to the <i>Philistines</i>.</p>

<p>Colonel F&mdash;&mdash;, an ancient gentleman of
grave deportment, gave into this sin so early in
his youth, that whenever his tongue endeavours to
speak common sense, he hesitates so as not to be
understood.</p>

<p>Thomas Pickle, gentleman, for the same crime,
banished to Minorca.</p>

<p>Muley Hamet, from a wealthy and hopeful officer
in the army, turned a miserable invalid at Tilbury-Fort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p><p>&mdash;&mdash;Eustace, Esq. for the murder of much of
the King's English in Ireland, is quite deprived of
his reason, and now remains a lively instance of
emptiness and vivacity.</p>

<p>Poor Daniel Button, for the same offence, deprived
of his wits.</p>

<p>One Samuel, an Irishman, for his forward attempt
to pun, was stunted in his stature, and hath
been visited all his life after with bulls and
blunders.</p>

<p>George Simmons, shoemaker at Turnstile in
Holborn, was so given to this custom, and did it
with so much success, that his neighbours gave
out he was a wit. Which report coming among
his creditors, nobody would trust him; so that he
is now a bankrupt, and his family in a miserable
condition.</p>

<p>Divers eminent clergymen of the university of
Cambridge, for having propagated this vice, became
great drunkards and Tories.</p>

When Adam and Eve, as the saints all believe,<br />
From the garden of Eden were driven;<br />
They put up a prayer to king Joe in his chair,<br />
That a boon he would grant them from heaven.<br />
'Twas in vain that old Jove 'gainst their petition strove,<br />
Madame Juno determined to grapple<br />
His arguments keen; said the thunderer's queen,<br />
"Where's the sin, pray, of stealing an apple?<br />
Send Momus, I beg, let him carry an egg,<br />
To earth's now disconsolate son;<br />
And bid Mistress Eve, that no longer she grieve,<br />
For the gods have enclosed them a <i>Pun</i>."<br />
Now downward the sprite on the earth did alight,<br />
And cracking the shell on the floor,<br />
Gave birth to a Pun, full of humour and fun,<br />
And sadness they never knew more.<br />

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>By the learned Author of Hermes.</i></span></p>

<p>On the subject of puns the late learned author of <span class="smcap">Hermes</span>
and Philological Inquiries has the following remarks and
extracts:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>A <span class="smcap">Pun</span> seldom regards <span class="smcap">MEANING</span>, being chiefly confined
to <span class="smcap">SOUND</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horace</span> gives a sad example of this <i>spurious</i> wit, where
(as <i>Dryden</i> humorously translates it) he makes <i>Persius</i> the
buffoon exhort the patriot <i>Brutus</i> to kill Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>, that is,
<i>Rupilius Rex</i>, because <i>Brutus</i>, when he slew <i>Cæsar</i>, had
been accustomed to <span class="smcap">KING-KILLING</span>.<br /></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 13.5em;"><i>Hunc</i> <span class="smcap">Regem</span> <i>occide; operum</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;"><i>Hoc mihi crede tuorum est.</i></span><br /></p>

<p>We have a worse attempt in <i>Homer</i>, where <i>Ulysses</i> makes
<i>Polypheme</i> believe his name was &#927;&#932;&#932;&#921;&#931;, and where the dull
<i>Cyclops</i>, after he had lost his eye, upon being asked by his
brethren who had done so much mischief, replies, 'twas done
by &#927;&#932;&#932;&#921;&#931;, that is, by <span class="smcap">NOBODY</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Enigmas</span> are of a more complicated nature, being involved
either in <i>pun</i> or <i>metaphor</i>, or sometimes in both.<br /></p>

PUNNING ON NAMES.<br /></div>



<p>The English are noted for punning on people's
names, in allusion to their talent or profession.&mdash;Grimaldi
was called, from his "grim faces," <i>Grim-all-day</i>;
Macready, from his quick study, "<i>Make
ready</i>;" Young, from his youthful appearance,
"the <i>young</i> actor;" Kean, from his new readings,
"the <i>keen</i> actor;" Sinclair, from his beautiful
voice, "Mr. <i>Sing clear</i>;" Miss Tree, the lovely
vocalist, "<i>the Mystery</i>," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.: innumerable
are the instances in the <i>political</i> world, but <i>quant.
suff.</i> Perhaps one of the most laughable of the
present day is the pun upon Mr. Thomas Bish,
the stockbroker's name; he was then at the head
of one of the most respectable tea-dealing establishments
in London. His friends sunk his Christian
name, excepting the first letter, and jocosely
called him Mr. <i>Tea</i> Bish: perhaps the joke was
borrowed from an epigram on Mr. Twining, the
tea-dealer, viz.</p>

<p>Here lies old John Magee, late the landlord at the Sun,<br />
He never had an <i>ail</i>, unless when all his <i>ale</i> was done:<br />
The Sun was on the sign, tho' what sign his sun was on,<br />
No studier of the Zodiac could ever hit upon.<br />
Some said it was Aquarius, so queerious he'd get;<br />
But he declared no <i>soda-hack</i> should ever share his <i>whet</i>.<br />
His burnish'd sun was sol-o, soul-heart'ning was his cheer,<br />
And quaffing of good <i>porter</i> long kept him from his <i>bier</i>.<br />
As draughtsman he'd no equal, his drawings were so good,<br />
And many a noble draught has he taken from the <i>wood</i>,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Rare <i>spirited</i> productions, with tasty views near <i>Cork</i>;<br />
And then he had a <i>score</i> or two <i>rum</i> characters in <i>chalk</i>.<br />
Above the mantel-taillee his tally it was nail'd,<br />
And though he had lost one eyesight, his <i>hop-ticks</i> never fail'd.<br />
Good ale and cider <i>sold here</i>, oft made the <i>soldier</i> halt,<br />
And sailor Jack, his sail aback, would hoist aboard his malt;<br />
Most cordially he'd pour out a cordial for the fair,<br />
Whose peeper meant to ogle the peppermint so rare;<br />
While buxom Jean would toss off the juniper so gay,<br />
And swear it was both sweet and nice as any <i>shrub</i> in May.<br />
At last John took to drinking, and drank till drunk with drink;<br />
His stuffing he would stuff in till stuff began to shrink;<br />
Tho' mistress shook her hand high, he suck'd the sugar-candy,<br />
And often closed his brand eye by tippling of the brandy.<br />
His servants always firking, his firkins ran so fast,<br />
And staggering round his bar-rails, his barrels breathed their last;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>And when he treated <i>all hands</i> his <i>Hollands</i> ran away,<br />
Nor reap'd he fruit from <i>any seed</i> for <i>aniseed</i> to pay.<br />
And though he drank the bitters, his bitters still increas'd,<br />
He puff'd the more <i>parfait au c&#339;ur</i> till all his efforts ceas'd.<br />
The storm, alas! was brewing, the brewer drew his till,<br />
And Mrs. Figg, for 'bacca, to back her brought her bill.<br />
Distillers still'd his spirits, but couldn't still his mind;<br />
He told the bailiff he would try a bail if he could find;<br />
But fumbling round the tap-room, Death tapp'd him on the head,<br />
So here he lies quite flat and stale, because, d'ye see, he's dead.<br />

<p>
TO BERNARD BLACKMANTLE, ESQ.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sir,</span><br />
</p>

<p>It has just been communicated to me, that you
are about to collect and publish a Punster's Pocket-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>Book,
for the express purpose of promoting that
<i>pernicious vice</i>, which is already much too prevalent.
As an antidote to the evil, I hope you
will <i>not fail</i> to insert this my special protest.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 28.5em;"><small>B. BASHFUL.</small></span><br />
</p>

<p>I am a bashful young man of good fortune, who,
to use the phrase of the mode, have just <i>come out</i>,
and made my <i>entré</i> into the world with the reputation
of being a gentleman and a scholar. I could
wish you to notice a minor evil in society which
tends to poison the springs of taste and knowledge,
by bringing forward the flippant, and throwing
back the reflective, speaker. I allude to the vice
of punning, which tends to destroy all the profit
and pleasure of conversation, and embarrass, in the
greatest degree, the young and inexperienced.</p>

<p>It is my fate to mix with a circle of fashionable
<i>dilettanti</i>, each of them capable of sustaining a part
in rational discourse, and of conducting the intellectual
conflict with some share of vigour and
learning; who, nevertheless, meet together to fritter
away time, patience, and attention, with a series of
unconnected quibbles and conundrums. Instead of
the rich web of fancy, glowing with the vivid creations
of lively, intelligent minds, the conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>presents a motley intermixture of shreds of wit and
patches of conceit, a chequer-work of incongruities,
the very orts and scraps of the "Feast of Reason,"
the dozings of science, and dregs of literature. If
I relate to this group of punsters the most affecting
circumstance, I am heard with impatience and inattention,
till I chance unwittingly to utter a word
susceptible of a double or triple interpretation.
The mischievous spark of folly immediately ignites,
the moral interest of my tale is undermined, and a
loud report of laughter announces the explosion.
The genius of orthography frowns in vain: puns
are, by the law of custom, entitled to claim entrance
into the sensorium either by the eye or the
ear: but when a pseudo pun ("for indeed there
are counterfeits abroad") is perceptible to neither
sense&mdash;when read, its wit is not discoverable; and
when heard, it cannot be understood: to avoid the
horror of an explanation, I find myself obliged to
perjure my senses by laughing in ignorance and
very sadness, and thus contribute a sanction to the
practice I would fain abolish. The evil is subversive
of the first principle of society. Is it little
to hunger for the bread of wisdom, and to be fed
with the husks of folly? Is it little to thirst for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>the Castalian fount, and see its waters idly wasted
in sport or malice? Is it little to seek for the interchange
of souls, and find only the reciprocity of
nonsense?</p>

<small>THE PUNSTER'S BOWL.</small><br /></div>

<p>The sovereign medicine of life,<br />
The antidote to care and strife&mdash;<br />
Is friendship, and the cheerful bowl,<br />
When humour meets a kindred soul:<br />
Then flows the epigram, and pun,<br />
From starry eve, to morning's sun;<br />
And Laughter, "holding both his sides,"<br />
The rubs and jeers of life derides.<br />
Then honest hearts, elate with glee,<br />
Forget the world, and black <i>ennui</i>;<br />
For nought like punch, and puns, can drown,<br />
The supercilious rich man's frown,<br />
Or free the heart, a prey to care,<br />
From fortune's ills and fell despair.<br />

<p>Among the few highly favoured individuals who
were included in the select evening parties of his
present Majesty, George the Fourth, while at
the Pavilion, Brighton, was the facetious Reverend
J. Wright. On one occasion the king suggested
to his brother, the Duke of York, some intention
he had of doing a particular act, to which the duke
dissented, and his Majesty referred to the D.D.
on which the reverend jocularly observed, "The
king can do no wrong." Then, said his Majesty,
"Fred. I shall pursue my object, for you hear I
have '<i>Wright Divine</i>' on my side."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>COOKE AND KITCHEN.</small></div>


<p>Sir George C., better known as Col. C., was said
to have had an intrigue with a Mrs. Kitchen.
When the king was told of it, he said, "It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
very natural that a Cooke should be fond of <i>Kitchen
stuff</i>, but if he meddles with the <i>Coles</i> he will get
out of the frying-pan into the fire." The <i>Coles</i>
were cousins to the lady.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>A DOWN HILL PUN.</small></div>


<p>Sir George Hill, the vice-treasurer of Ireland,
and a near relative to the Londonderry family, was
among the visitors at the Pavilion. Dr. Tierney
remarked, that Sir George was getting old and
feeble&mdash;"If I mistake not," replied the king, "he
is going <i>down hill</i> very rapidly."</p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Hume</span> and <span class="smcap">Croker</span> had a sharp contest last
night," said the Earl of Liverpool to his Majesty,
"but it ended in <i>smoke</i>." "I don't wonder at that,"
replied the monarch; "The <i>Fire</i> of <i>Croker</i> was
sure to <i>smoke</i> like Irish <i>turf</i> beneath the weight of
Scotch <i>Hume-i-dity</i>."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir Edmund Nagle</span> said he wondered that the
king of France did not feel offended at the <i>squibs</i>
let off against him in the English newspapers.
"Pshaw!" said the king, "he would be a fool
indeed to be frightened at a <i>squib</i> in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
when at Paris he is sitting on a <i>barrel of gunpowder</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>LORD ELDON'S PUNNING JEU D'ESPRIT.</small></div>


<p>In an application to his Lordship for an injunction
to restrain the proprietors of the "Gazette
of Fashion" from selling the song of "We're
a' Noddin," the Chancellor perceiving the trifling
nature of the cause, after hearing the defendant,
observed, "I will dismiss both parties, by granting
an injunction against <i>Cease your Funning</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>LORD STOWELL,</small></div>


<p>On a recent occasion, having taken his seat in
the Admiralty Court, inquired separately of the
advocates, if they had any motion to <i>move</i>; and
being answered in the <i>negative</i>, the judge very
good humouredly replied, "Then, gentlemen, the
best thing we can do will be to <i>move ourselves</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>GEORGE CANNING AND EARL BATHURST.</small><br />
<i>Kicking the Bucket.</i></div>


<p>As the Earl Bathurst and George Canning were
walking along Pall Mall, the Earl struck his foot,
by accident, against a small pail, (which some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
careless servant had left at the door), and turned it
over; "Why, your lordship has <i>kicked the bucket</i>,"
said the facetious orator; "No, not so bad as that,
George," replied the witty earl, "I've only <i>turned
a little pale</i> (i. e. <i>pail</i>)."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>LORD ERSKINE.</small></div>


<p>Few persons ever enjoyed a greater facility of
punning upon the ancient languages than his lordship.
For instance, on one of the articles of his
breakfast apparatus, Lord E. had inscribed <i>Tu
doces</i>, literally <i>Thou&mdash;Tea&mdash;Chest</i>.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON IN ACTION.</small></div>


<p>"Your Grace speaks without <i>reason</i>, and too
much in a <i>passion</i>," said a Spanish brunette to
whom he had made a <i>proposal</i>, and was <i>pressing</i> it
somewhat <i>close</i>. "Ah! my dear little angel," said
the great captain, "<i>reason</i> has nothing to do with
<i>love</i>; and <i>passion</i> is very desirable when we are on
the point of <i>entering</i> into <i>immediate action</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>TURN IN AND TURN OUT.</small></div>


<p>A noble lord who was aide-de-camp to the Duke
of Wellington, visited the Duke early on the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of the battle of Salamanca, and perceiving him lying
on a very small camp bedstead, observed that his
Grace "had not room to <i>turn</i> himself." The Duke
immediately replied, "When you have lived as
long as I have, you will know that when a man
thinks of <i>turning in</i> his bed, it is time he should
<i>turn out</i> of it."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><small>ROGERS ON TASTE.</small></div>


<p>When the Marquis of Hertford opened his
splendid hotel in Piccadilly, Mrs. Coutts was one
of the visitors present&mdash;much to the annoyance of
certain of our fair nobility. In reply to an observation
of <i>hers</i>, upon the splendour and magnificence
of the furniture and decorations, Rogers
archly remarked, that, "besides splendour, there
was so much good taste in the <i>ornaments</i> and <i>society</i>&mdash;every
thing in the rooms was so <i>chaste</i> and
<i>delicate</i>."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><small>HOSPITALITY.</small></div>


<p>Jack Bannister, praising the hospitalities of the

"No," replied the wit, "but I have seen a great

<div class="figcenter"><small>LUTTRELL AND ROGERS.</small></div>


<p>Luttrell and Sam Rogers met together at the

seeing some very shabby men about the door, they
were afraid they were bailiffs in search of them.
Not knowing which was in danger, and wishing to

them, said, "Pray, gentlemen, are you <i>Fox-hunting</i>,

<div class="figcenter"><small>LORD ROSS.</small></div>


<p>The witty Lord Ross having spent all his money
in London, set out for Ireland in order to recruit
his purse. On his way he happened to meet with
Sir Murrough O'Brien, driving for the capital in
a lofty phaeton, with six fine <i>dun</i>-coloured horses.
"Sir Murrough," exclaimed his Lordship, "what
a contrast between you and me! I have left my

you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>DR. JOHNSON.</small></div>


<p>Early one morning, the Doctor passing by the
end of the Old Bailey, observed a great crowd collected,
and upon inquiring of Boswell what it
meant, was informed that one <i>Vowel</i> was going to
be hanged for forgery. "Well," replied the
Doctor, "it is very clear, Bozzy, that it is neither
<i>U</i> nor <i>I</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>AN UNFORTUNATE CELEBRITY.</small><br />
<i>Dr. Johnson.</i></div>


<p>A pert young fellow who had made some abortive
attempts as an author, and notwithstanding
the shallowness of his pretensions, was on excellent
terms with himself, had long been labouring for an
opportunity of being introduced to the Doctor, and
at length succeeded in obtaining an invitation to
Mr. Thrale's. Having taken proper means to be
frequently accosted by his name, which, in his own
fond imagination, was "<i>fama super æthera notum</i>,"
he sat for some time in expectation of being accosted
by the Lexicographer. Finding, however,
that his hopes were vain, he at length ventured to
break the ice. Approaching the Doctor with a
smile of self-sufficiency, "My name, Doctor Johnson,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>said he, "is&mdash;&mdash;; you have probably
heard of me as being of some celebrity in the literary
world." "Yes, I have indeed," was the sarcastic
reply he received, "of <i>very unfortunate
celebrity</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>DR. PARR ON WANTS.</small></div>


<p>The Doctor used to say, that a man's happiness
was secure in proportion to the <i>small number of
his wants</i>; and he added, that, all his life, he had
endeavoured to prevent the multiplication of them
in himself. A Mr. <span class="smcap">Ketch</span>, on hearing this, said
to him, "Then, Doctor, your secret of happiness
is, to <i>cut down your wants</i>." "<i>Suspend</i> your
<i>puns</i>, Mr. <i>Ketch</i>," said the Doctor, "and <i>I will
drop</i> you the hint: <i>My</i> secret is, <i>not to let them

<p>As William Spencer was contemplating the caricatures

actor retorted&mdash;"Sir, I thought you were only to
be a <i>Spectator</i>; instead of that you are turning

to a dinner party to meet the celebrated Dr. Parr.
"What!" said Horne Tooke, "go to meet a
country schoolmaster, a mere man of Greek and
Latin scraps! that will never do." Some time
after this, he met Dr. Parr in the street, and addressed
him with, "Ah! my dear Parr, is it you?
how gratified I am to see you!" "What, me?"
replied Parr, "a mere country schoolmaster, a
man of Greek and Latin scraps?" "Oh my good
friend," rejoined Horne Tooke immediately, "those

of each regiment was nominally reported
to be complete at embarkation for England, but
when landed at the other side, many of them had
not a quarter of their numbers. "No wonder,"
said Mr. Curran, "for after being <i>mustered</i>, they

<p>"<i>Sic sine Morte Mori</i>," was given by some wag
as a toast, when Lord Chesterfield and Lord Ty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>rawley
were both present, at a very advanced age,
when Lord Chesterfield said, "Tyrawley and I
have been <i>dead</i> these two years; but we don't

<div class="figcenter"><small>SAM FOOTE ON PLAYING TOO HIGH.</small></div>


<p>A German baron at a gaming-house, being detected
in an <i>odd trick</i>, one of the players fairly
threw him out of the one pair of stairs window.
On this outrage he took the advice of Foote, who
told him "never play <i>so high again</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>FELIX M'CARTHY.</small></div>


<p>Felix M'Carthy passing through Clement's Inn,
and receiving abuse from some impudent clerks,
was advised to complain to the Principal, which he
did thus: "I have been abused here by some of
the <i>rascals</i> of this inn, and I come to acquaint you
of it, as I understand you are the <i>Principal</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>TIERNEY <i>v.</i> FOX.</small></div>


<p>Mr. Fox, in the course of a speech, said, "If any
thing on my part, or on the part of those with whom
I acted, was an obstruction to peace, I could not
lie on my pillow with ease." George Tierney (then
in administration) whispered to his neighbour, "If
he could not <i>lie</i> on his pillow with ease, he can <i>lie</i>
in this house with ease."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><small>LEE LEWIS ON THE GAME LAWS.</small></div>


<p>Lee Lewis shooting in a field, the proprietor attacked
him: "I allow no person (said he) to <i>kill
game</i> on my manor but myself; and I'll <i>shoot you</i>,
if I find you here again." "What! (said the
comedian) do you mean <i>to make game of me</i>?"</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>CALEB WHITFOORD AND HIS NEPHEW.</small></div>


<p>The late Caleb Whitfoord, finding his nephew,
Charles Smith, playing the violin, the following
bits took place:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>W.</i> I fear, Charles, you <i>lose</i> a great deal of <i>time</i>
with this fiddling.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> Sir, I endeavour to <i>keep time</i>.</p>

<p><i>W.</i> You mean rather <i>to kill time</i>.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> No, I only <i>beat time</i>.</p></blockquote>



<div class="figcenter"><small>JOHN KEMBLE MURDERING TIME.</small></div>


<p>When Kemble was rehearsing the romance sung
by <i>Richard C&#339;ur de Lion</i>, Shaw, the leader of
the band, called out from the orchestra, "Mr.
Kemble, my dear Mr. Kemble, you are <i>murdering
time</i>." Kemble, calmly and coolly taking a pinch
of snuff, said, "My dear Sir, it is better for me to
murder Time at once than be continually <i>beating</i>
him as you do."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>SHERIDAN ON LOVE FOR LOVE.</small></div>


<p>Sheridan complained that Congreve's "<i>Love for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Love</i>," had been so much altered and modified to suit
the delicate ears of modern mawkishness, that it was
quite spoiled. It is now (said he) like modern
marriages, with very little of "<i>Love for Love</i>" in
it. "His plays," said the wit, "are, I own, somewhat
licentious, but it is barbarous to mangle them:
they are like horses; when you deprive them of their
vice, they lose their vigour."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>THE MORNING POST ON PREFERMENT.</small></div>


<p>An auctioneer having turned publican, was soon
after thrown into the King's Bench; on which the
following paragraph appeared in the Morning Post:
"Mr. A., who lately quitted the <i>pulpit</i> for the <i>bar</i>,
has been promoted to the <i>bench</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>SIR J. PARNELL</small></div>


<p>Became a general <i>toast</i> in Ireland after the Union,

was told, "Ah! but it's amply made up to you in

Covent Garden theatre, to see Macbeth: when the
hero questions the witches what they are doing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
they answer, "a deed without a name." Our counsellor,
whose attention was at that moment directed
more to Coke upon Littleton than Shakspeare,
catching, however, the actor's words, repeated, "A
<i>deed</i> without a <i>name</i>! why, 'tis <i>void</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>RALPH WEWITZER.</small></div>


<p>The comedian meeting a young friend, observed
how well he looked. "Ay, (says the other) I have
a rare good appetite, and I take care that it be

eat a <i>great deal</i> to breakfast." "Then (observes

friend, "I may be an actor, but I will not attempt
to be a <i>Shooter</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>LORD NELSON'S ARMS.</small></div>

having solicited Lord Nelson to permit him to put
up his <i>arms</i>, and change the <i>name</i> of the inn to
<i>The Nelson Hotel</i>; his lordship returned for answer,
that he was perfectly welcome to his <i>name</i>,
but he must be sensible that he had no <i>arms</i> to

<div class="figcenter"><small>SOME OF CURRAN'S BEST.</small></div>


<p>A severe Irish judge, being at dinner among an
assemblage of lawyers, Mr. Curran asked his lordship,
if he should have the pleasure of helping him
to a slice of pickled tongue which stood before him.
"If it were <i>hung</i> (said his lordship), I would try
it." "If <i>you</i> were to <i>try</i> it (replied Curran), it
would be sure to be <i>hung</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>CURRAN'S COVENTRY JOKE.</small></div>


<p>On some one proposing to send an Irish barrister

said the wit, "that is carrying the joke a little
<i>too far</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>CAPITAL JOKES.</small></div>


<p>While a counsellor was pleading at the Irish bar,
a louse unluckily peeped from under his wig.
Curran, who sat next to him, whispered what he

Mr. Curran) you have many such <i>jokes</i> in
your head, the sooner you <i>crack</i> them the better."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>ON DISCIPLINE.</small></div>


<p>MacNally was very lame, and when walking, he
had an unfortunate limp. At the time of the Rebellion
he was seized with a military ardour, and
when the different volunteer corps were forming in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Dublin, that of the lawyers was organized. Meeting
with Curran, MacNally said, "My dear friend,
these are not times for a man to be idle; I am determined
to enter the Lawyers' Corps, and follow
the camp." "You follow the camp, my little limb
of the law!" said the wit, "tut, tut, renounce the
idea; you never can be a disciplinarian." "And
why not, Mr. Curran?" said MacNally. "For
this reason," said Curran, "the moment you were
ordered to march you would <i>halt</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>LORD NORTH'S PUN CLASSICAL.</small></div>


<p>A gentleman told Lord North, that from a variety

used to ride?" "I have sold her." "Then you

<div class="figcenter"><small>LORD BYRON TO ROGERS ON PUNNING.</small></div>

<div class="figcenter"><small>THE ARCH-BISHOP AND HIS ARCH-CURATE.</small><br />
<i>Pun beneficial.</i></div>


<p>Sir William Dawes, archbishop of York, delighted
in a good pun. His clergy dining with
him the first time after the decease of his lady, he
said he feared the company would not find things
in so good order as they were in the time of poor
<i>Mary</i>, adding with a sigh, "Ah! she was indeed
<i>Mare Pacificum</i>." A curate, who pretty well knew
the truth of the matter, got himself completely into
favour by observing, "Ay, my lord, but she was
first <i>Mare Mortuum</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>DR. GOLDSMITH AND SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</small><br />
<i>A pun spoiled.</i></div>


<p>At a dinner of wits, a dish of pease was brought
in, become almost grey with age. "Carry these
pease to Kensington!" said one of the party. "Why
to Kensington?" said another. "Because it's the
way to <i>Turn'em green</i>." Dr. Goldsmith going
home in the evening with Sir Joshua Reynolds,
observed, that he would have given five pounds to
make so excellent a pun. "You shall have the
opportunity (said the knight) on Tuesday, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
you are to dine with me, and none of the same
company will be present." Tuesday came, and
the dinner was served up; amongst the other
dishes a plate of pease of the same description.
"Carry these peas to Kensington," said Goldie.
"Why so?" "Because it's the way to <i>make them

<div class="figcenter"><small>DR. BROWN'S TOAST.</small></div>


<p>Dr. B. long but unsuccessfully paid his addresses
to a young lady, whom he used always to give as
a toast. Dining one day with a friend, the latter
filling his glass, said, "Come, doctor, I'll give you
your favourite <i>toast</i>." He answered, "You may
do as you please; but for myself, I have already

<div class="figcenter"><small>R. PEAKE TO R. MARTIN, M.P.</small></div>


<p>"Sir," said the humane M.P. to the facetious

"<i>Steer's</i> of <i>Cow</i>-lane."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>R. PEAKE AND WINSTON.</small></div>


<p>The punster, having occasion to call upon the

replied, "he knew that to be true, for he was indebted

<div class="figcenter"><small>PEAKE'S "STOUT MAN"</small></div>

<p>Mr. Dennis, a gentleman who died about 1764,
and was famous for his puns, was once ridiculed
for it in a copy of verses by three gentlemen, whose
names were Goodwin, Johnstone, and Marshall;
he answered them in the following manner: "If
<i>Good</i> be the better half of thy name, it is so little
in thy nature as not to be perceived, though in conjunction
with thy friend <i>John</i>, thou hast helped to
make such a noble copy of verses that they ought
to be engraven on <i>stone</i>. I would have given
steel the preference, if a certain person did not <i>Mar</i>
your works, so <i>shall</i> say no more of the matter."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />


<p>[There are very few literary persons in London, at
least among those connected with the public press,
who have not occasionally enjoyed the pleasant,
<i>punning</i>, conversational powers of my friend
W. R. V. whose whim, wit, and great good
nature are not more esteemed, than his unaffected
manners, and sincerity of disposition justly entitle
him to.]</p>


<p>Some one observed, "<i>Matches</i> are made in
Heaven." "Yes," answered he, "and they are
very often <i>dipped</i> in the other place."</p>

<p>Two men contending at a tavern upon the point
of who wrote that beautiful song on Ingratitude,
"Blow, blow, thou wintry wind!" one said Ben
Jonson; the other said Shakspeare. R.V. to adjust
their differences, observed, "They must have
written it between them, for each was <i>a-verse</i> to
ingratitude."</p>

<p>A fat gentleman who was at a loss for the name
of the nobleman who was shut up in a tower and
starved to death, applied to the punster&mdash;"<i>You-go-lean-O!</i>"
was the reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"A tailor is the <i>ninth part</i> of a man," observed
a would-be-wit, in the presence of a knight of the
sheers: "But," answered R.V. "a fool's <i>no part</i>
at all."</p>

<p>"He that will pun will pick a pocket," observed
an old cynic. "You speak from <i>experience</i>," was
the <i>stopper</i> to this <i>vinegar cruet</i>.</p>

<p>Rhodes, the punning landlord of the Coal Hole
tavern, took the Bell Inn at Hammersmith: R.V.
hoped that as he had so long answered the <i>bell</i>, the
<i>Bell</i> would now <i>answer</i> him.</p>

<p>One asked him what works he had in the press.
"Why, the History of the Bank, with <i>notes</i>; the
Art of Cookery, with <i>plates</i>; and the Science of
Single Stick, with <i>wood cuts</i>."</p>

<p>A person told him that Louis dix-huit, when
he entered London, put up at Grillon's hotel. "I
am surprised at that," said he; "his father took
his <i>chop</i> at <i>Hatchett's</i>."</p>

<p>A barber recommended him his aromatic essence
for the improvement of his hair. "No, no;
don't waste your fragrance on the <i>desert hair</i>."</p>

<p>A friend remarked of a gentleman with very
large curly whiskers, that he said nothing. "Poor
fellow; don't you see he's <i>lock-jawed</i>?"</p>

<p>"How well you put on your cravat," said a crony:
"that <i>tie</i>'s something new."&mdash;"Yes; it's a <i>novel-tie</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>He pacified a quarrelsome fellow one evening by
observing, "I should not like to go up in a balloon
with you, for fear of our <i>falling out</i>."</p>

<p>Seeing a porter bring in an edition of a new work
of his from the press to his bookseller, "Dear me!"
he exclaimed, "what a <i>weight is off my mind</i>."</p>

<p>"What a swell you are in your new frock coat,"
said a quiz to him one day. "Don't you like it?&mdash;I
do: indeed I'm quite <i>wrapped up in it</i>."</p>

<p>The same person meeting him one day in the
city, observing he had on a new waistcoat, asked if
it was a <i>city cut</i>. "No," answered he, "it's a
<i>west-cut</i>."</p>

<p>Dining at the Wrekin tavern, he asked for a
wine glass: the waiter, in bringing it, inadvertently
let it fall&mdash;"Zounds! I did not ask you for a
<i>tumbler</i>!"</p>

<p>Sitting in company with one of those people who
find fault with every thing, good, bad, or indifferent,
he could not refrain from quizzing the old
fellow. "True, true; we have nothing <i>new</i> or
<i>good</i> now-a-days: Waterloo bridge is a <i>catchpenny</i>,
Herschell's telescope <i>all my eye</i>, the steam engine
<i>a bottle of smoke</i>, and the safety-coach <i>a complete
take in</i>."</p>

<p>Bearcroft the classic observed to him, that learning
was <i>pabulum animi</i>, food of the mind. "Yes,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
replied he, "and that's the reason, I suppose, the
collegians wear <i>trencher</i> caps."</p>

<p>On George the Fourth landing at Calais in 1820,
the wind was so boisterous as to blow off his foraging
cap, greatly inconveniencing him: a brave
officer, Captain Jones of the Brunswicks, who stood
near, presented His Majesty with his own, which
the King graciously accepted, and wore until he
got to his carriage. This drew from him the following
impromptu:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"Whether in peace or war,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">If hostile dangers frown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">It is the soldier's care</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">To guard his Monarch's <i>crown</i>."</span><br />
</p>

<p>He blamed a friend for dedicating a very clever
work to a certain nobleman, notorious for his stupidity.
"My book wanted a <i>title</i>," was the reply.
"Oh!" he observed, "but it might otherwise have
been <i>peer-less</i>."</p>

<p>On Sir Robert Wilson's motion for investigating
the affair that deprived him of his rank as General
being lost, he lamented it as very hard that they
should refuse him "<i>even a major-ity</i>."</p>

<p>Being proposed a member of the Ph&#339;nix Club,
he asked when they met:&mdash;"Every Saturday evening
during the winter."&mdash;"Then," said he, "I shall
never make a Ph&#339;nix, for <i>I can't rise from the fire</i>."</p>

<p>A good <i>Pun</i> has, from time immemorial, been
quite as admissible in our courts of law, as a good
<i>plea</i>; and not unusually has proved successful with
the feelings of a jury, when the latter, left entirely
to the more weighty arguments of <i>precedents</i> and
<i>rejoinder</i>, would only have produced a temporary
suspension of the understanding. Lord Norbury's
talent as a punster is proverbial, and his wit upon
all occasions as clear as his judgments are sound:
scarcely a packet of Irish papers arrive in the
sister kingdom, but the first inquiry of the humourist
is after the last <i>good thing</i> of the Chief
Justice's; and, if he fails to encounter a <i>new pun</i>,
he retreats homewards like a city sportsman, without
<i>game</i> for the morrow; for <i>pun-less</i>, he is quite as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>miserable as if he was <i>penny-less</i>; and if he cannot
<i>crack</i> a new joke at the club, he is like to go <i>cracked</i>
himself with vexation in consequence.</p>

<p>It is one of the evils attending eminence in any
art, that many loose performances will be attributed
to genius, for the sake of notoriety, which
would cause a blush upon the cheek of the talented
individual under whose cognomen they are surreptitiously
launched forth into public life. Every
new pun, made by the Emeralders, whether invented
in the <i>Four Courts</i> of Dublin, or at the
midnight orgies held in the <i>broad</i> and <i>narrow
Courts</i> of London, at the Fives <i>Court</i> or the Tennis
<i>Court</i>, the King's <i>Court</i>, or the <i>Courts</i> of law and
equity, are all heaped upon the <i>great original</i>,
Lord Norbury; who has, in consequence, as many
<i>sins</i> of this sort to bear with, as any <i>criminal</i>
that ever appeared before his legal tribunal. In
selecting from an accredited stock, the compiler of
this little book has endeavoured to affix to the

in, as may not disgrace his witty family.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>LORD NORBURY'S MOTTO</small></div>


<p>Is, "<i>Right can never die</i>;" then, said his lordship,
punning thereon, "<i>right</i> must be <i>left</i> for ever."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><small>AN AMOROUS PUN.</small></div>


<p>"Who is that lovely girl?" exclaimed Lord Norbury,
riding in company with his friend Counsellor
Grahaarty. "Miss Glass," replied the barrister.
"<i>Glass!</i>" reiterated the facetious judge; "by the love
which man bears to woman, I should often become
intoxicated, could I press such a <i>glass to my lips</i>!"</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>THE JOKER'S RETORT.</small></div>


<p>The numerous and severe animadversions on
Lord Norbury in the Imperial Parliament, only
afforded his Lordship an opportunity for a supplemental
criticism, viz. "That the English Broom
(Brougham) wanted an <i>Irish stick</i> to it;" an appendage
which, in the early part of his Lordship's
career, he certainly would have been very ready to
furnish.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>PENCILING WITH A PICKAXE.</small></div>


<p>The late Counsellor Egan, well known by the
appellation of <i>Bully Egan</i>, from his rough courage,
got into the Irish parliament during the administration
of the late Marquis of Rockingham, and
joined with the Whigs of that day in a most outrageous
opposition to the administration of the
noble Marquis, upon the question of regency, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the opposition succeeded in voting the unlimited
regency of Ireland to the Prince of Wales. The
Marquis, unable to rally, fled to England without
beat of drum, leaving the oppositionists masters of
the political field. Not content with this retreat,
the Whigs continued to pelt the character of the
noble Marquis, by way of <i>post obit</i>, and to heap all
those maledictions upon his administration, when
defunct, which they had so indefatigably done
while living. Amongst the rest, Mr. Egan, in the
course of a debate, thought proper to introduce in
his speech an episode, in which he proposed, "Now
that the Marquis was politically dead, to <i>pencil</i> his
epitaph;" and this he did in such coarse and ponderous
words, that Mr. Toler, the present Lord
Norbury, in his reply, termed this effort of Egan,
<i>penciling with a pickaxe</i>.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>TIME AND ETERNITY.</small></div>


<p>On passing sentence of death upon a prisoner
who had been convicted of privately stealing a <i>time
piece</i>, Lord Norbury, after dwelling upon the enormity
of his crime, concluded a very impressive
speech by observing, that he had been <i>grasping</i> at
<i>time</i>, and caught <i>eternity</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><small>THE CANAL AND LOCKS.</small></div>


<p>Meeting with a lady in Dublin who was possessed
of considerable property in a distant part of
the country, and in whose welfare he had taken
great interest, particularly during the progress of a
bill through parliament for draining her lands, he
accosted her, "Ah, my dear Mrs. G&mdash;&mdash;, how d'ye
do?&mdash;how goes on your <i>water ways</i>?&mdash;I must
come and take a view of your little <i>canal</i> and
<i>locks</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>DROPPING THE SUBJECT.</small></div>


<p>A man having been capitally convicted before
Lord Norbury, was, as usual, asked what he had to
say why judgment of death should not pass against
him&mdash;"Say!" replied he, "why, I think the joke
has been carried far enough already, and the less
that is said about it the better; so if you please,
my lord, we'll drop the subject." "The <i>subject</i>
may <i>drop</i>," replied his lordship.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>JAM SATIS.</small></div>


<p>A gentleman helping his Lordship to some pie
made of raspberry jam, inquired if he would have
some more fruit? "<i>Jam satis</i>," replied the punster.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><small>THE CRITICS CURTAILED.</small></div>


<p>"Lord Byron calls his abusers <i>dogs</i>," said a
friend to Lord Norbury; "No doubt he wishes
them and their censures <i>cur-tailed</i>," was the reply.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>SHAKE-SPEARE.</small></div>


<p>Riding one day with a friend of the name of
<span class="smcap">Speare</span>, whose horse appeared to jolt him very
much, his Lordship could not help observing it.
"He is young, and awkward in his paces, but may
mend," said Speare. "By the bye, my Lord, I
want a name for him." "It must be <i>Shake-speare</i>,
then," retorted his Lordship.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>KING AND JAMES, THE DUBLIN LORD MAYORS.</small></div>


<p>Sir Abraham Bradley King, Lord Mayor of
Dublin, declined, through prudential motives, from
giving, during his mayoralty, the Orange toast, so
offensive to the King James's party. <span class="smcap">James</span>, the
next Lord Mayor, was not so particular, but gave
it at his first dinner. Lord Norbury, who was
present, could not help observing, "You are no
friend to <i>King</i>,&mdash;<i>James</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><small>CURLED HAIR.</small></div>


<p>Lord Norbury calling one day on Mrs. O'Connor,
the mattrass-maker in Sackville Street, Dublin,
who is a very pretty woman, remonstrated with her
on having so long delayed sending home his order:
"Sure your Lordship," said the good woman, with
great <i>naiveté</i>, "there's <i>no curled hair</i> to be had
now in Dublin, neither for <i>love nor money</i>." "By
the powers above," replied his Lordship, looking
amorously, "but it was very plentiful in this city,
Mrs. O'Connor, when I was a <i>curly boy</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>TRIAL OF A HORSE.</small></div>


<p>Late on a Saturday evening, as Lord Norbury
had concluded charging the jury, after a laborious
and long trial, when they retired to make up their
verdict, a barrister got up to make a motion respecting
a horse, that had been returned to a jockey
for not being sound. His lordship complained of
his being much tired after the business of the day,
and begged they would postpone the business till
Monday. The lawyer, anxious to push forward
the business, said it would only occupy him a few
minutes to <i>try it</i>. His Lordship rising, said in his
usual dry way: "Gentlemen, to-morrow is a holiday;
you will have time and leisure to <i>try the
horse yourselves</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><small>A DRY WIPE.</small></div>


<p>Lord Norbury being in company with some
lawyers, was asked, had he seen a pamphlet that
was written by O'Grady, in which he was reflected
on? replied, "Yes, yes, I took it to the water-closet
with me." When told who was the author,
he replied, "Ha! I did not think my friend Grady
intended me such a <i>wipe</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>HOW TO CUT A FIGURE IN THE TEMPLE.</small></div>


<p>Lord Norbury, while indisposed, was troubled
with a determination of blood to the head. Surgeon
Carrol accordingly opened the <i>temporal artery;</i>
and whilst attending to the operation, his Lordship
said to him, "Carrol, I believe you were <i>never
called to the bar</i>?" "No, my Lord, I never was,"
replied the surgeon.&mdash;"Well, I am sure, Doctor,
I can safely say <i>you have cut a figure in the
Temple</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>THE GAME JOKE.</small></div>


<p>On being informed, last autumn, of the elopement
of Mrs. Moore, whose maiden name was
Woodcock, Lord Norbury said, "Then we must
look out our <i>fleecy hosiery</i>."&mdash;"Why so, my Lord?"
"Because it is an unerring symptom of a sudden,
long, and severe winter to see, so early in the
season, the <i>Woodcocks forsake the Moors</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><small>MAJESTICALLY MOUNTED.</small></div>


<p>Lord Norbury, meeting the Marchioness of
Conyngham and Lady Elizabeth riding on horseback
in the Ph&#339;nix Park, took occasion to admire
the beauty of their horses: "The gift of His
Majesty," said her Ladyship artlessly: "and
Lady Elizabeth's is also a royal present."&mdash;"Then
I understand," said Lord Norbury, "His Majesty
<i>mounts you both</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>A SPORTING PUN.</small></div>


<p>A gentleman on circuit narrating to his Lordship
some extravagant feat in sporting, mentioned that
he had lately shot thirty-three hares before breakfast.&mdash;"Thirty-three
<i>hares!</i>" exclaimed Lord Norbury:
"Zounds, Sir! then you must have been
firing at a <i>wig</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>THE FEMALE LINGUIST.</small></div>


<p>A report having reached his Lordship that a
female pedant, who was well known as a blue
stocking and linguist, was about to be married, he
observed, "He could answer for her disposition to
<i>conjugate</i>, but feared she would have no opportunity
of <i>declining</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><small>HOPE AND JOY.</small></div>


<p>At a trial in the Irish Court, Mr. Hope, an
eminent attorney, being employed as agent in a
certain cause, apologized to the court for the absence
of Mr. Joy, his counsel, requesting that it
would delay for a few minutes, till Mr. Joy, who
was engaged in another court, would return. Some
time having elapsed, Lord Norbury addressed the
bar, saying, "Gentlemen, I think we had better
proceed with the business of the day&mdash;although</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15.5em;">'<i>Hope</i> told a flattering tale,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15.5em;">That <i>Joy</i> would soon return.'"</span><br />
</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>A RUM WITNESS SENT TO QUOD.</small></div>


<p>A witness being interrogated by Lord Norbury,
in a manner not pleasing to him, turned to an acquaintance,
and told him in a half whisper, that he
did not come there to be <i>queered</i> by the old one.
Lord Norbury heard him, and instantly replied in
his own <i>cant</i>, "I'm <i>old</i>, 'tis true, and I'm <i>rum</i> sometimes&mdash;and
for once I'll be <i>queer</i>, and send you to
<i>quod</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><small>A LATE DINNER.</small></div>


<p>Mr. Curran was to dine with Lord Norbury,
when Mr. Toler. His dinner hours were late,
which Mr. Curran always disliked. Mr. Toler
was going to take his ride, and meeting Mr. Curran
walking towards his house, said, "Do not forget,
Curran, you dine with me to-day." "I rather
fear, my friend," replied Mr. Curran, "it will be
<i>so long first</i>, that you may forget it."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>CUT AND COME AGAIN.</small></div>


<p>In a celebrated trial, wherein Mr. Trumble was
plaintiff, and Mr. Allpress of Abbey-street, defendant,
before Lord Norbury and a special jury,
Mr. Serjeant Johnson, Counsellor Leland, and one
or two more very fat barristers were employed for
the defendant. The opposite bar were remarkably
thin spare men, viz. Messrs. Goold, North, Pennyfather,
&amp;c. Mr. Johnson, in defending his client
from paying a penal rent, in the heat of argument
said, "My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, the
opposite party stand forth like Shylock in the play,
with their knife outstretched <i>to cut from us</i> the
very pound of flesh!" Lord Norbury very tritely
interrupted the learned serjeant by saying, "Mr.
Johnson, the opposite bar perhaps conceive you
<i>can spare it better</i>."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><small>A NOTE TAKER TRANSPORTED.</small></div>


<p>When it was told to Lord Norbury, that sentence
of transportation to Botany Bay was passed upon
the notorious Mr. Smith, who had been detected in
clandestinely pocketing some notes off the vestry-room
table, after the collection for the Charity
Schools of St. Michael's Church, in November
1819, he jocosely replied, "that he thought it very
hard, as it was no uncommon thing to have <i>note
takers</i> at all such public meetings."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>CLOSE SHAVING.</small></div>


<p>The Persian Ambassador having, among other
public places, visited the Irish Courts of Justice,
in November Term of 1819, coming into the Court
of Common Pleas whilst it was sitting, the business
was suspended for a short time, to view so extraordinary
a personage, he being fully dressed in the
eastern costume, long beard, &amp;c. After he had
retired, one of the Judges asked Lord Norbury
what he thought of him, his Lordship wittily
replied, "he might be a very <i>clever man</i>, but he
was certain he was not a <i>close shaver</i>."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>THE RACKET COURT.</small></div>


<p>The counsel in the Irish courts are not always so
decorous and attentive as they should be. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the examination of a witness, Lord Norbury had
occasion once or twice to request silence; when the
man, in a reply to a question from his lordship relative
to his occupation, answered that "he kept a
<i>racket court</i>." "Indeed," said the judge, and
looking archly at the bar, continued, "and I am
very sorry to say that I am Chief Justice of a
<i>racket court</i> much too often."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><small>POT LUCK.</small></div>


<p>A certain Irish musical amateur, who was very
irritable, had a party of vocal and instrumental
friends on a particular evening in every week at his
own house; when some wags, more desirous of promoting
discord than harmony, used to assemble under
his windows, making the most hideous noises,
or in the Irish phraseology, "<i>giving him a shaloo</i>,"
upon which the amateur dislodged the contents of a
certain chamber utensil upon the heads of some
passers by, but unfortunately missed his persecutors.
For this assault an action was brought and tried
before Lord Norbury, who, in summing up the case
to the jury, good humouredly observed, "that the
plaintiffs must be considered in the light of <i>uninvited
guests</i>, and it could not be denied that they
had been treated by the defendant with <i>pot-luck</i>."</p>


<p>In a humorous trial between the rival managers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Messrs. Daly and Astley, respecting the right of
the latter to perform the farce of "My Grandmother,"
at the Peter-street theatre, Dublin, Daly's
counsel stated, that the penalties recoverable
from the defendant, for his infringement of the
rights of the patent theatre, would all be given to
that excellent charity the Lying-in Hospital. Mr.
Toler, in reply, observed, "That it was notorious,
no man in Dublin had contributed more largely, <i>in
one way</i>, to the Lying-in Hospital than Mr. Daly;
and it was therefore but fair, if he recovered in this
action, that he should send them <i>the cash</i>. But,"
continued the facetious counsel, "although Mr.
Daly's attachment to <i>good pieces</i> is proverbial, we
do not choose that he shall monopolize all the <i>good
pieces</i> in Dublin, from '<i>My Grandmother</i>' down
to '<i>Miss in her Teens</i>.'"</p>

whose "loud sounds" he was unfortunately placed.
He expressed his uneasiness so frequently, that the
performer made use of the word "man-milliner" once

One day the father and son passing along, saw a

of dad, however, restraining his tongue, he

<p>At a church in Ireland, where there was a popular
call for a minister, as it is termed, two candidates
offered to preach, whose names were Adam
and Low. The latter preached in the morning,
and took for his text, "<i>Adam</i>, where art thou?"
He made a very excellent discourse, and the congregation
were much edified. In the afternoon
Mr. Adam preached upon these words, "<i>Lo!</i> here
am I." The impromptu and the sermon gained
him the appointment.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><small>HORNE TOOKE'S PEDIGREE.</small><br /></div>

<p>Horne Tooke having, in a political argument,

<p>1. The Count de Sedan held that little state as a
fief of the crown of France, of which he was in other
respects a subject. Louis XIV. wishing to put his
paw upon this domain, had the Count arrested and
clapped into the Bastille, on a supposed charge of
treason. The result was, that, in order to save his
life, he gave up his possessions; on which the wits
of Paris made this pun&mdash;"<i>Il donnoit Sedan</i> (ses
dents) <i>pour sauver sa tête</i>."</p>

<p>2. Madame de Stael has been much admired for
her handsome figure, and particularly her fine arm,
but unfortunately disfigured by her deformed foot.
Being in a gallery at Paris, where there was an
empty pedestal, vain of her person, she mounted,
and placed herself in an attitude to display her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>

peeped out. A wit approached, and seeming to
look only at the pedestal, exclaimed, "<i>O le vilain
Pie-de-stal!</i>"</p>

from the court of France to the Ottoman <i>Porte</i>,
was afterwards sent, in a diplomatic capacity, to
the Hague; but on account of some ceremonial
being neglected, he refused to enter the gates of
that place. This gave occasion to the wits of
Paris to observe, that he was still "<i>ambassadeur

London traveller to a timber merchant. "No,

"There is no being <i>cross-grained</i> with you," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the timber-merchant. "Not unless you <i>cut</i> me,"
retorted Blackstrap, "and you are not <i>sap</i> enough

wine-merchant, "if we do not get a little fruit, I

<p>About the time of the issue of the new crown-pieces,
Messrs. Bish and Sparrow, the advertising
tea-dealers, though strongly opposed to each other,
for two of a trade never agree, set about, highly to
their credit, a reformation in the price and quality
of the "fragrant lymph." An old Irish woman,
fond of a cup of "good mixed," thought, what

<div class="figcenter"><small>A SPORTING PUN.</small><br />
<i>Managing the Pack.</i><br /></div>

<p>A country gentleman, who was celebrated for
taking the lead with some of the first-rate hunts,
became so much reduced in circumstances by his
attachment to gaming, as to accept the office of
<i>dealer</i> at a gambling table. A friend (like Matthews's
Dr. Prolix), with infinite promptitude, observed,
"that he continued to follow his old predilection,
for he still <i>managed the pack</i>."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><small>A PUNSTER'S APHORISMS.</small><br /></div>

<p>If you mean to be a <i>domestic</i> animal, never marry
a woman of a <i>wild</i> disposition. An <i>ugly helpmate</i>,
though she may have the wealth of <i>Plutus</i>, and the
<i>virtues</i> of an <i>angel</i>, can never be considered as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
<i>lovely wife</i>. If you would live happily, always
<i>whistle</i> when your wife <i>whines</i> or <i>scolds</i>. If she
should grow <i>furious</i>, take yourself into the <i>cool air</i>,
without trying to pacify her. A man who exposes
himself to a <i>storm</i> is sure to get <i>pelted</i>. Never
offend the ears of a modest woman by a coarse or
indelicate expression: the <i>fairest mirror</i> is stained
by a <i>passing breath</i>. Never marry a woman for
<i>money</i>, lest, obtaining the <i>honey</i>, you are stung by
the <i>queen bee</i>. Never lose an opportunity for
making a <i>good pun</i>, when you can do it consistent
with <i>good nature</i>, and without endangering the
esteem of <i>good friends</i>. A <i>pun</i>, to pass <i>current</i>,
should bear the <i>stamp</i> of <i>wit</i>, and be <i>struck</i> off in
the <i>mint</i> of <i>originality</i>. A <i>genuine bad pun</i> is not
always a <i>bad joke</i>. <i>Late</i> hours make <i>lazy</i> servants,
a <i>loquacious</i> wife, and end in making a <i>long</i> purse
<i>light</i>, a <i>long</i> illness <i>heavy</i>, and <i>long life</i> very uncertain.</p>

<small>A FRAGMENT.</small><br /></div>


<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> This highly celebrated little book, it will by some be remembered,
was written to ridicule Sir John Carr's 'Stranger in Ireland;' and a
more happy, witty, original, and pleasant satire, is not to be found
in the English language. The book is now <i>out of print</i>, and only
to be met with in the libraries of the curious. Had I any reason to
suppose that the author (Mr. Dubois), would have republished his
work, much as I should have had to regret the loss of these articles
here, I certainly would not have taken them to do injury to their
own witty and original parent.</p></div>

<p>We observe in Homer's <i>Batrachomyomachia</i>, that the
instant the frog Calaminthius sees the mouse <i>Pternoglyphus</i>,
he is so frightened that he abandons his shield
and jumps into the lake: and this confirms our etymology
of the mouse's name, <i>Turn ugly face</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p><p>In the same poem, also, we find a warrior-mouse
called <i>Lichenor</i>, which some, who, like certain commentators
on Shakspeare, will always be running to the
Greek for interpretations, consider as signifying <i>one
addicted to licking</i>, but here we see the imbecility of
foreign resources, and the great strength of our own.
Their explanation is certainly something near the
mark, but for a mouse, how much more germain to the
matter is ours&mdash;<i>Lick and gnaw</i>? It is true, that I
may have mistaken the sense of my opponents' language,
but even granting them the full latitude of understanding
by their words, as applied to our military mouse,
that he was <i>one addicted to licking or conquering</i>, yet
is it by no means so full and expressive as it appears in
our exposition. Besides, it must be remembered that
<i>Lichenor</i> was not so much "addicted to licking" as to
being licked, witness the frog Hypsiboas's running him
through the body with a rush. See I. 202.</p>

<p>At v. 244, we have the mouse <i>Sitophagus</i>, who like
many a soldier of modern times had recourse to his heels
and betook himself to a snug dry ditch&mdash;[Greek: êlato d'es
taphon]. I had always some suspicion that this name
was particularly corrupted in the last syllable, and the
foregoing circumstance has, fortunately for the literary
world, furnished me with a conjecture that seems to
place the etymology of this coward's title beyond all
doubt:&mdash;<i>Set off again</i>&mdash;his invariable custom on these
occasions, which was perhaps owing to his having studied
the <i>art militaire</i> in Hudibras, where he learnt that</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Timely running's no mean part</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;"><i>Of conduct in the martial art.</i></span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sitophagus</i>, from <i>Set off again</i>, is perfectly within
the canon of <i>parcè detorta</i>, which it may not be amiss
here to repeat:</p>

<p>"New words are allowable, if they descend," says
Horace, "from the English<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> spring, with a sparing
distortion."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Anglo <i>fonte cadent, parcè detorta</i>.
</p><p>
So Horace doubtless wrote, and thus I always read the passage,
correcting the corruption (<i>Græco</i> fonte) which has so long obtained,
to the injury of truth and good letters.</p></div>

<p>I have neither leisure nor inclination to go through
the whole of the names of the heroes in Homer's battle
of the frogs and mice; nor is it necessary, for it must
be apparent to every ingenuous critic that they are <i>all
derived from one source</i>. Such, however, as occur to
me elsewhere, and are thought by many to have very
different roots, I shall notice for the purpose of dispelling
the clouds of error, and restoring the light of
truth.</p>

<p><i>Pallas.</i> This word should be written thus <i>'Pallas</i>,
with an apostrophe, as in the instance of <i>'fore</i> for <i>afore</i>.
Its origin then clearly appears. The goddess was so
called on account of the Gorgon's head on her shield,
that had the power of killing or turning into stone,
which was indeed enough to <i>Appal us</i>.</p>

<p>In a very singular work, printed in 1611, and entitled
<i>Stafford's Niobe</i>, I find something like an attempt to
prove that the goddess of wisdom acquired the name of
<i>Pallas</i> from the <i>Paleness</i> she occasions in her followers.
The author's words are simply, "Pallas, whose liverie is
paleness," which, if allowed to have any etymological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
bearing, will, from their date, at once deprive me of all
credit for originality in this department of philology.
The learned reader is left to decide on this nice point.</p>

<p><i>Venus</i>, from <i>wean us</i>, as it is even now elegantly pronounced
by many. As the heavenly Venus had that
power with the Gods, so has each earthly one with us,
namely, to <i>wean us</i> from all other earthly things, and
hence the undoubted derivation.</p>

<p>&#7977;&#947;&#949;&#956;&#969;&#957;, or <i>Egemon</i>, with the Greeks, meant a general,
and is very evidently borrowed from a vulgar
phrase amongst us, most pointedly significant of the
office of a general, with respect to his soldiers, viz. to
<i>egg 'em on</i>. It will be observed, that I have sunk the
aspirate, which is a mere vulgarism in the Greek speaker,
as in such instances as the following amongst ours, viz.
"<i>Hi ham</i>" for I am.</p>

<p><i>Macrones</i>, a people on the confines of Colchis, and I
should suppose, though Flaccus does not mention it,
and I have no leisure to turn to Herodotus, remarkable
for their partiality to dress, since the word is clearly an
abbreviated pronunciation of <i>Macaronies</i>.</p>

<p><i>Celsus.</i> This philosopher composed a treatise against
the Christians, which having a good sale, one of the
Christians, in a merry mood, said, he <i>sells us</i>, and from
that moment he bore his present name.</p>

<p><i>L. Mummius</i>, a Roman consul, who acquired his cognomen
of <i>mummius</i>, or <i>mummy us</i>, from being sent
against the Achæans, whom he beat most unmercifully.</p>

<p><i>Boreas.</i> This wind was long without a name, until
the people feeling its northern blasts exceedingly
troublesome, would be continually crying, "how they
<i>bore us</i>!" which in time gave rise to the word <i>boreas</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
or as it was originally pronounced <i>bore us</i>. Here we
presently come at the etymology of the verb <i>to bore</i>,
which has hitherto baffled all research and made futile
every conjecture. It cannot be questioned that the
Persian <i>Boreus</i>, and <i>Borus</i> the son of Perieres, had their
names from some such obnoxious qualities as are attributed
to the wind, though we are at a loss to guess
what they were, and are by no means willing to venture
an hypothesis that may lead to indecency. It is
worthy of remark, as an astonishing fact, that these
gentlemen are mentioned by Polyænus and Apollodorus,
but without a word in the <i>Stratagems</i> of the one, or in
the <i>Bibliotheca</i> of the other, that throws any light on
the matter.</p>

<p><i>Philostratus.</i> A famous sophist, and very liberal and
expensive in his entertainments, from which circumstance
his friends very properly gave him the cognomen
of <i>fill us, treat us</i>. The penultimate of Philostratus is
short in its derived state, but this is a liberty perfectly
excusable in these cases, and coming assuredly under the
description of <i>parcè detorta</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mannus.</i> It is imagined that this divinity obtained
his name from having once undertaken to furnish some
<i>fleet with men</i>; but from being a German God, and for
other reasons, I confess that I have no great faith in
this etymology.</p>

<p><i>Æsymnus.</i> This anxious politician's consulting
Apollo, according to Pausanias, on the subject of legislation,
made the witlings of his time call the God his
nurse, and then in ridicule exclaim <i>ease him nurse</i>,
which speaks for itself.</p>

<p><i>Bacchus</i>, or <i>Back us</i>; and admirably so called, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>cause
he is found to be the second best in the world, inspiring
courage even in a coward.</p>

<p><i>Confucius.</i> About the etymology of the title of this
famous Chinese philosopher, we are much in the dark;
but it seems in the greatest degree probable that he obtained
it from being a philosopher of the modern description,
who put every thing into <i>confusion</i>.</p>

<p><i>Damon.</i> This poet received his name from a circumstance
that attended his banishment from Athens.
When the sentence was brought to him, he began
d&mdash;ning and swearing most bitterly, on which the officer,
a rough fellow, said, "Oh, you may <i>Damn on</i> as
long as you like, it does not signify, you must go."
And go he did, but still swearing; and the people, who
are tickled with a feather, hearing the officer's observations
repeated, nicknamed him <i>Damon</i>, or as it was formerly
written and spoken, <i>Dammon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Alala.</i> The goddess of war. See Plutarch de Glor.
Athen. So called because the moment she took the
field on any side, that side had the battle <i>all hollow</i>.</p>

<p><i>Æsacus.</i> He persecuted a nymph so much who did
not like him, that she at last plunged into the sea, and
was metamorphosed into a parrot, and in that state still
continued to exclaim, as she was wont, <i>he's a curse</i>,
which soon became the lover's appellation.</p>

<p><i>Titans.</i> A title given to the sons of C&#339;lus and
Terra, by Saturn, when they warred against him.
They were at first known as Hyperion, Briareus, &amp;c.;
but when the god heard that they were about to fight
with him, he smiled, and cried, "Ay, ay,&mdash;ecod they're
<i>tight 'uns</i>!" and this name has distinguished them
ever since.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>The above word reminds me of an eastern one&mdash;[Hebrew: nodba]
or <i>Abaddon</i>, which will as indubitably as a thousand
instances of <i>the like nature</i>, prove the superior antiquity
of the English language over that of the Jews, as well
as that of the Greeks, and it is very probable, <i>in an
equal degree</i>, over every other, dead or alive. Abaddon
is a name belonging to the devil, and <i>the most ignorant</i>
will not scruple to confess that they plainly perceive its
expressive etymology in <i>A bad 'un</i>.</p>

<p>In fine&mdash;sunt certi denique <i>fines</i>&mdash;There have been
writers who have scarcely left Troy or its famous war
"a local habitation and a name;" others go still further,
and say that no such man as Homer, the author
of the Iliad, ever existed; and a third party, proceeding
another step, talk of proving incontestibly that there
<i>never were any ancients</i>. But one wise man (with whom
I am proud to join issue) positively affirms, that those
who are called the ancients were born in the infancy of
the world, and do not deserve the title, but that we who
live in this enlightened age, with all the wisdom of
past times at our command, are, truly speaking, the
just and legitimate ancients. This, being <i>reasonably</i>
substantiated, lends its powerful assistance to confirm
the opinion respecting the prime antiquity of our native
tongue, and I cannot conclude without indulging the
irresistible impulse I feel to acknowledge, that I have
no more doubt than I have with respect to <i>any thing
yet stated</i>, that it will ultimately prove to be the <i>universal
language</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Prefatory remarks on the art of punning&mdash;its antiquity
from Homer's <i>outis</i>, through Sophocles, Cicero,
&amp;c. down to Shakspeare, &amp;c. Its advantages over wit.
Wit requires wit in the hearer to comprehend it&mdash;a
lasting and insuperable objection to its universality.
Puns, on the contrary, require no wit to make them,
nor any to understand them. Prove this by their well-known
effect on stupidity in drawing-rooms, theatres,
&amp;c. An act to abolish punning would be the destruction
of three-quarters of what are called the <i>wits</i> of our
times, and fifteen-sixteenths of the dramatic writers.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances of fashion and prevalence,
a man might as well go into a gambling house without
knowing how to play, as into company without knowing
how to make himself agreeable by punning. Rules are
necessary for the acquisition of every art. Let what
Ovid desired to have said of him, in respect to love,
be said of me, with regard to punning&mdash;"<i>Magister

but let <i>them</i> attend to the parson, you may be
preparing puns against dinner-time, when you expect a
party.</p>

<p>The man of the house is nothing without his wife.
It is becoming that she should assist you&mdash;she is your
<i>help-mate</i>. Connive together, and let her put <i>leading
questions</i>. Half an hour before dinner&mdash;company come.
All very stupid as usual. Mrs.&mdash;&mdash; observes, that she
fears that the dinner will be rather late, as she was
obliged to take <i>Adam</i>, the footman, to the park, on account
of the children. The husband immediately remarks,
that Adam may be <i>the first</i> of men, but he is <i>a
damn</i> slow fellow.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs.</i>&mdash;&mdash;. My dear <i>Tom</i>, you deserve a <i>Cane</i> for
that.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i>&mdash;&mdash;. Ay, if you were <i>Able</i> to give it to me,
who am a <i>host</i> to-day. Perhaps you were on the <i>Eve</i>
of saying this; well, there's as much chance in these
things as in a <i>Pair o' dice</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 27em;">(<i>A general laugh.</i>)</span><br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Here you are at the end of this excellent subject. I
don't know that any thing more can be made of it.</p>

<p>N.B. Hire no man unless his name is <i>Adam</i>, or he
will suffer you to call him so.</p>

<p>Let your children enter. Miss Lucy, George, and
Theodore, all punsters, but this day is devoted to the
father. Call your daughter, <i>Lucy</i>, because, if you are
a <i>profound</i> scholar, you can frequently bring in "<i>luce</i>
clarior." Your other girl, <i>Sally</i>, ran away with an
apothecary. Mrs.&mdash;&mdash; will say this, and you'll exclaim,
"Ah, <span class="smcap">Sal</span> <i>volatile</i>!"</p>

<p>Invite a poor French priest<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> to your table at these
times. He is always to ask, when your children appear,
"<i>Est ce qu'ils sont tous par la même mère</i>?"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> The word <i>Emigré</i>, which appears in this article as before printed,
would at once destroy the <i>unquestionable</i> right Swift has to the honour
of this MS. for <i>Emigré</i> did not obtain in our language till long
after his death.</p></div>

<p>When you are to reply&mdash;"Yes, I believe they are all
by the same <i>mare</i>, but I won't answer for the horse<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> This has been given to Foote; but dates decide.</p></div>

<p>This is not very complimentary to your wife; but it
would be a pretty joke indeed, if a good pun was to be
lost for such a trifling consideration.</p>

<p>If you consult decency too much, there's an end of
wit. He who digs for diamonds must not be over
squeamish about dirt. Here Mrs.&mdash;&mdash; may say, "My
dear <i>Tom</i>, I wish the man would bring up the dinner."</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. "<i>Bring up</i> the dinner, my love? Heaven
forbid! As Dido says, that's '<i>sic sic</i>,' so so<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>You must not be too nice, as I observed before.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 22.5em;">(<i>Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; rings the bell.</i>)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;"><i>Enter Servant.</i></span><br />
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. Is dinner ready?</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> (<i>Looking round.</i>)&mdash;The <i>chops</i> are, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Adam</i>. It is dishing now, ma'am.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 18.5em;">(<i>A crash heard as if an accident.</i>)</span><br />
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash; <i>Dishing</i> indeed&mdash;I fear it's <i>dished</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;"><i>Dinner&mdash;all seated.</i></span><br />
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. Will any body take soup?</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. What, before grace, you <i>grace</i>less rogues.
There's no parson here, I see; though we are not without
some of <i>the cloth</i>. Well, I'll say it&mdash;grace at
dinner is <i>meet</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>[A universal laugh. The sight of dinner is a breeder
of good-humour.]</p>

<p>Take care to have the salt-cellars put on the table
empty.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. Why what the devil's this&mdash;no salt!</p>

<p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. (As planned.)&mdash;You have <i>salt</i> enough,
I'm sure, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. "Ego <i>pun</i>ior ipse," Ovid. Very well,
very well! my wife is not a<i>miss</i>: but the salt, Adam.</p>

<p><i>Adam.</i> Sir, the house-keeper's gone out, and I don't
know where to get any.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. Why an't here four <i>salt</i> <span class="smcap">sellers</span>?</p></blockquote>

<p>[The Frenchman does not understand this, but he is
to laugh heartily nevertheless.]</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. Here, Adam; take this key, and you'll
find some in the store-room, at the top of the house.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p><blockquote><p><i>Mr.</i>&mdash;&mdash;. <i>Attic salt</i>, eh! ha, ha, ha! Well, come
let's fall to; this meat will <i>keep</i> no longer without
salt.</p>

<p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. My dear <i>Tom</i>, that rich dish will only
give you the gout.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. Pooh! "Chacun à son <i>gout</i>." Why
should not I eat it, as well as another?</p>

<p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. Bless me, how you mangle that duck.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. <i>Mangle</i> it, my love. Well, I think that's
better than to <i>wash and iron</i> it; but tell me how you'll
have it done, and you shall find me <i>duc</i>tile.</p></blockquote>

<p>[Many opportunities will offer of making <i>obscene puns</i>,
but I give no rules for these; they come naturally to
every punster! All I shall say is, that they must <i>never</i>
be neglected.]</p>

<p>Let your cook be famous for pancakes. One of your
little boys must inquire for some.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. My dear, this is Sunday; you know we
can't have pancakes till <i>Fri</i>-day.</p></blockquote>

<p>[Many more puns must be introduced. <i>Champaign</i>,
<i>real pain</i>; <i>after all</i> cheese is best, &amp;c.]</p>

<p>The company will, probably, add some, and you may,
also, by accident; however, you'll have this advantage
over your friends, that you'll be certain of all these
while you're with your wife, and at home. Your acquaintance,
of course, have <i>names</i>, and if they have no
other merit, it's very hard if you can't make something
of them in the pun way. Any blockhead can do that.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><small>DESSERT.</small><br /></div>


<blockquote><p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. "Give every man his <i>deserts</i>." Shakspeare.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. My love, shall I send you a peach?</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. Yes, and if it isn't a good one, I'll im<i>peach</i>
your judgment.</p></blockquote>

<p>By connivance with the Frenchman, he must offer
you a pinch of Maccuba snuff, saying he's sorry it is
not better, but his Tonquin bean has lost its flavour.
You then reply&mdash;Ay, I see it's one of the <i>has</i>-<span class="smcap">beens</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. Oh! that's too bad.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. Why, it's wit at a <i>pinch</i>, at any rate;
therefore it need not <i>make you baw&mdash;l</i>, as if I had got
into the wrong <i>box</i>.&mdash;(<i>Turning to the boys.</i>)&mdash;What's
Latin for goose, eh!</p>

<p><i>Boys.</i> Brandy, papa!</p>

<p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. You'll kill yourself with that vile liquor.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. How can that be&mdash;Isn't it eau de <i>vie</i>?</p>

<p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;, at some time, must call for the nutmeg
grater.&mdash;You take it, and address your neighbour: Sir,
you are a great man, but here is a <i>grater</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The sweetmeats will be praised of course.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. All my wife's doing. Nancy's a notable
woman, I assure you; but I'm more <i>not able</i> than she
is, an't I, my dear?</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="margin-left: 13em;"><i>Ladies all rise.</i></span><br /></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. (<i>Blushing.</i>)&mdash;I can take a hint. My
dear, pray touch the bell.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. (<i>Chucking a young lady under the chin.</i>)&mdash;Yes,
my love, I'll touch the <i>belle</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. (<i>Going.</i>)&mdash;You wag!</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> &mdash;&mdash;. No, I think you <i>wag</i>, but&mdash;(<i>bowing</i>)&mdash;I
<i>bow</i> to you.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ladies gone, the gentlemen need no instructions.
They will all have recourse to their <i>mother tongue</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the most ignorant will shine the most. The master
must begin with half a dozen obscene puns, to make
himself agreeable, and the conversation general<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Here I have run my pencil through several puns on the ladies'
retiring. Though he says it is unnecessary, <i>Swift</i> could not help
indulging the natural bent of his genius, which is a strong proof of
the authenticity of the MS. An additional evidence appears in a
query in a memorandum made on the margin of this MS. for the
puns for a <i>farmer</i>. Some one, who has rye-fields, is to write to him&mdash;Pray
send <i>me men to mow rye</i>? and he is to return a skull.
<i>Memento mori</i>&mdash;Don't you see? But query&mdash;will <i>mowing</i> rye do
for any but <i>our Irish farmers</i>?</p></div>


<div class="figcenter"><small>THE TEA TABLE.</small><br /></div>


<blockquote><p><i>Mr.</i>&mdash;&mdash;. (<i>Entering after all the rest.</i>)&mdash;Ah! Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;, what
I see you are <i>at home</i> to a <span class="smcap">t</span> to-night.</p>

<p><i>Boys.</i> Pa, we have had no tea.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i>&mdash;&mdash;. "Sine <i>te</i> juventas." That's wrong. It
is <i>right</i> that you should not be <i>left</i> out.</p>

<p><i>Mrs.</i>&mdash;&mdash; purposely sends a dish of tea to a lady,
without sugar, of which she complains.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i>&mdash;&mdash;. (<i>Handing the sugar basin.</i>)&mdash;Well, ma'am,
if you do not like it, you may <i>lump</i> it.</p></blockquote>

<p>[Miss Lucy plays on the piano-forte, but is to fail in
her first attempt.]</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs.</i>&mdash;&mdash;. (<i>As planned.</i>)&mdash;That comes of playing at
sight.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i>&mdash;&mdash;. At <i>sight!</i> Why what the deuce would
come if she was to shut her eyes?</p></blockquote>

<p>If any thing like serious or sensible conversation
should be introduced, and there's no knowing what
some dull fellow may not do, put an end to it at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
with a pun. If he talk of war, suppose he means the
<i>Pun</i>-ic war, and say that in your battles you are with
Livy&mdash;"<i>Punc</i>tim magìs quam c&#339;sim peto hostem."
If he speak of the army, look archly at your wife, and
say you expect soon to have a son <i>in arms</i>, &amp;c. Should
he mention the Prince of Wales, inquire, which is
greater, the <span class="smcap">Dolphin</span> <i>of France</i> or the <i>Prince of</i>
<span class="smcap">Wales</span>? solving the question immediately with Juvenal's</p>


<div class="figcenter">"<i>Delphinis Balæna Britannica major.</i>"<br />
Than <span class="smcap">Dolphins</span> greater is the <span class="smcap">British Whale</span>.<br /></div>


<p>Now something about going into <i>Bed</i>fordshire and
the land of <i>Nod</i> will wind up what is commonly called
a very pleasant day, full of wit, humour, and repartee.
I must not forget to observe, that, if you can add any
<i>practical jokes</i>, which lead to puns, and fall <i>at all short</i>
of murder, the treat will be improved.</p>

<p>Viz. Pinch a piece out of a man's arm, to say you did
not know there was any <i>harm</i>. Break his shin&mdash;that's
<i>leg</i>-al. Pull away his chair<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> when he is sitting down&mdash;you've
<i>good ground</i> for it. Run your head against his&mdash;<i>two
heads</i> are better than one. Overturn the milk-jug
on him&mdash;then he's in the <i>milky way</i>. So with the
urn&mdash;then he's in <i>hot water</i>. When he hops about, say
he seems in a <i>lame</i>-ntable way. Let the boys knock the
candle into some lady's lap&mdash;this you may call a <i>wick</i>-ed
thing, &amp;c. &amp;c. Intersperse these, with other such amiable
pleasantries as these, and all the fools (a commanding
<i>majority</i> in every <i>assembly</i> in the country),
will shout for joy, extol your wit, and applaud your
ingenuity.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> <i>Memorandum.</i> This joke is recommended, by the <i>surgeons</i>, for
all seasons; but, in my <i>system</i>, better arranged, it will be proper to
distinguish. In the <i>winter</i>, when the carpet's down, you are glad to
bring that affair on the <i>tapis</i>. In the <i>spring</i>, the <i>earth</i> begins to
<i>bear</i> every thing. In the <i>summer</i>, it's "summum jus," because it's
"<i>summa</i> injuria," and the carpet being up, you give him <i>board</i> with
<i>a deal</i> of pleasure, that's <i>plain</i>: and in the <i>autumn</i>, you allude to

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
